My appointment with Dr PERSON was Very good and she was extremely empathetic and helpful However list below the problems about the way the surgery is being run which I hope will be taken seriously as I know many other patients who have the same concerns The changes to the practice since before Covid have not been an improvement The reception staff s attitude has changed considerably and from a patient point of view not for the better There is no empathy and a reluctance to be constructively helpful which verges on rudeness I have experienced finally getting through on the phone after waiting a long time only to be told I am past the cutoff so have to call back at 2 00 There ought to be a number reserved for people like me who care for an elderly person with dementia and who doesn t know how the day will pan out I can t always be hanging on the phone at 8 30 in the morning or 2 00 pm My husband is 91 has vascular dementia and mobility problems Recently I witnessed one of your receptionists remark to a patient who arrived clearly in distress and trying to see a doctor for an emergency appointment at 11 15 that she was too late and anyway would need to speak to a doctor on the phone before she could get a face to face The distressed lady who was having trouble with her breathing said that A E had told her to come to her surgery if she experienced breathing trouble again The receptionist offered no empathy or support remember that A E had instructed this lady to go to her GP All your receptionist could repeat to her was she would have to call on the phone at 2 00 for an appointment for an initial telephone triage with a doctor The receptionist then stated that a drop in surgery would be chaos clearly she hadn t been in the job very long because one of the main reasons we transferred to PERSON hope Mews West surgery from Redcliffe was precisely because there was a daily drop in surgery and it was never chaos See below my most recent incident at your surgery as an illustration of the calibre and attitude of your reception staff At the beginning of January I brought in a urine sample for my husband having been instructed to do so on Christmas Eve by the out of hours doctor My husband actually spent Christmas day and Boxing day in the PERSON Westminster with Covid as well as a UTI On discharge the PERSON Westminster doctor also confirmed I should bring a sample to the surgery for follow up testing I brought in the sample and the lady at reception told me that she couldn t help because I had no form and no doctor from the practice had requested the sample After much pleading she reluctantly agreed to contact a practice doctor for a form Why she couldn t consult my husband s records to see what had happened to him over Christmas I do not know After nearly half an hour another lady from reception asked her how she had contacted the doctor about my husband s sample By email came the reply The other lady then told her to message a doctor and came out to see me She apologised for the unhelpful attitude and said it shouldn t have happened I nearly wrote to complain then but my life is complicated looking after my husband so I didn t This survey has given me the opportunity to air my grievances,positive,0.4260372519,598.0,4.0,Follow-up and Continuity of Care,optimism,0,0.4260372519

I have not had a recent appointmen but I thought I would answer anyway My experience is that when I need a doctor I find it hard to get an appointment unless urgent I need to have a telephone consultation first I was once told I think it was for a persistent and annoying cough that I had had for months after a laryngitis and I wanted to know if there was a cough medicine I could take I was told I should go to A and E but it was not THAT urgent I just needed advice I was quite disappointed and then went to a private GP She saw me the day afterwards scheduled a chest Xray and got me a prescription Also some friends of my age we are all oldies get check ups by their GP but so far I have had to ask for blood tests sometimes asked for by my cardiologist sometimes because I felt a long time had gone by I am aware that COVID has been very detrimental for everybody patients and doctors from many points of view and my problems are minor compared to others However as a result I am stuck seeing a private dermatologist My check ups for a suspicious mole on my back I live alone and have no way to check this myself were continuously cancelled or postponed but I needed it to be seen on consultant s advice in three months Admittedly this was not the GP it was the hospital Now I would be happy to see the GP for regular check ups rather than going to the private consultations So it would be useful to have a regular check up that is my point I have been seen by different doctors not often and they were very nice and one in particular was helpful getting me quick appointments for my thyroid problem I have been impressed with the notices I receive for vaccinations and general information like recently when I was given a possibility to be checked for atrial fibrillation I would have come but was out of the country The staff at the reception is always helpful and kind,negative,0.5672797561,365.0,3.0,Appointment Availability,disappointment,0,-0.5672797561

The surgery clearly has too many patients Getting any appointment has been so difficult that I have had to go private Despite the fact that I m one of the highest tax payers in this country I have limited access to my GP I think it s absolutely appalling that patients have to wait over a week sometimes to get an appointment and then that appointment is solely over the telephone You can t diagnose chest infections over the phone Plus my mother has really been suffering for over a year with pain in her legs hips and groin and was not seem at all Instead she was sent off to some physio to get some exercise pointers She was only given one session and no one has bothered to follow up despite saying they would Plus the surgery focuses its attention on all the wrong things simply to fulfil government mandates rather than actually take care of patient needs I miss the old surgery when there was a walk in for more urgent enquiries and there was better client care Frankly this surgery should not be taking on any more patients because it is incapable of taking care of the patients it does have,negative,0.8871939778,201.0,1.0,Appointment Availability,disappointment,0,-0.8871939778

It s very frustrating the process of booking any appointments the waiting time to see a doctor is for a phone call with the doctors 1week while for a in person appointment is 2 weeks Receptionists take liberty to decide if you are urgent or not and booking the appointments accordingly saying the doctors are busy then when you go in person there isn t anyone in the clinic and doctors are free The doctors take everything lightly and they don t even check your symptoms refuse to make referrals to the NHS and suggest to go privately Sometimes i wait 2 3months before seeing my GP as I know the answer will always be you have nothing so don t worry by only looking my face,negative,0.8232258558,122.0,2.0,Waiting Time,annoyance,0,-0.8232258558

The front desk staff are dedicated and so good at their job I can t speak more highly about the service they provide and some of the doctors including Doctor PERSON who is currently with the practice have been admirable However there is no consistency and no follow through After being referred to a specialist department for further investigation the box is ticked and the patient is cast adrift and left to sink or swim because unless they make a fuss and pester the practice after the referral they are not contacted again Half the problem is that the doctors are never in the practice for any length of time Just as the patient gets to know a doctor and more Importantly the doctor gets to know the patient and take an interest in them the doctor is moved on and the patient has lost the invaluable link with someone who is familiar with their medical history it is just a conveyor belt of people on the move and the insight and help a doctor can provide through personal knowledge of the patient is lost The thing is not all practices are like this Friends in Forest Gate with a tremendous diversity of patients from all over the world where a team of interpreters is on standby tell me the NHS treatment they receive from their local GP Practice is outstanding and very personal with patients being rung by doctors to see how they are doing and same day appointments are nearly always available,positive,0.7161306143,254.0,,Follow-up and Continuity of Care,neutral,0,0.7161306143

PERSON is the best she was extremely supportive and kind throughout my appointment Dr PERSON was also amazing with my partner for his appointment However my appointment with Dr PERSON was not good and I don t feel comfortable talking to her again she started off our appointment with incorrect assumptions that I was privately diagnosed with ADHD but she had my diagnosis letter up on her screen with the NHS logo in the corner and it also explains in the first few lines that it is Right To Choose she immediately went on to mention the influx of private diagnoses and the BBC panorama whilst I understand her concerns her approach was not a good one at all and showed heavy skepticism which immediately make me uncomfortable I was caught off guard and did get a little emotional but not massively whilst she did backtrack from this once I explained how ADHD affects my life which is why I got emotional how it is harmful for her as a clinician to take the approach she is taking especially largely quoting a very damaging sensationalist TV program as opposed to reliable sources and how frustrating it is to have waited for so long to be diagnosed to be told that I may not be able to get medication when it isn t our fault as patients that the ADHD waiting lists are so long I wouldn t mind doing a regular NHS assessment but the issue is that we can t access them not that we as patients don t want to and are choosing to pay for a diagnosis which I didn t anyhow I do sympathise with her concerns and understand as a clinician she should raise any concerns she has my problem is that she didn t take an open minded curious approach and on top of that when I later read her notes on my record I realised that she has gotten the details largely incorrect facts she recorded about my life as well as recording that I was upset that she needed to discuss things between the team which isn t the case at all I was only upset about the approach having being caught off guard and frustrated by the ADHD system overall given how massively it impacts my life A more kind curious and sympathetic approach would have been appreciated and I don t feel that referring to the panorama is very appropriate as a source of information given the issues with the reporting I feel uncomfortable asking to correct the notes because I don t want to come across as difficult or pedantic or for it to have a negative impact on my relationship with the practice or my future care I have had largely positive interactions with the NHS but the negative ones including a previous misdiagnosis where the clinician ignored my concerns have had a damaging impact on my confidence in the healthcare system and made me rather reluctant to engage with it I try not to be cynical but it feels hard to advocate for yourself as a patient and it s also been very difficult to access treatment aside from Right to Choose not in terms of referrals because I ve not experienced any issues there at all my past GP was great with this I haven t yet needed any at The Chelsea Practice but in terms of waiting lists it feels a little pointless to try,positive,0.3565507233,565.0,4.0,Waiting Time,disappointment,0,0.3565507233

I joined the Redcliffe Surgery in 1965 That is nearly 60 years ago The current ethos has lost the human ethos of yesteryear partly for reasons that cannot be overcome in the present situation of massive underfunding of the NHS the stupidity of Brexit ever more pressure from ever more patients and much else I know it is harder and harder BUT if you want to improve there is room for improvement 1 My wife is almost 102 years of age I think anyone 80 yrs and more the genuine elderlies need much more careful watching and monitoring especially in regards to the need for follow up Things that a specialist might ask the surgery to do are not done as if the message never got through The follow up in the surgery needs improving more generally 2 It is often necessary to follow up with one s GP and getting through to them can feel like too many hoops to jump If I have a blood test and get a very technical feedback I won t understand it The GP out to explain a complicated list of outcomes automatically 3 I have been seen over months by the Tissue Viability department at St Charles When no longer seen by them they claimed a letter to my surgery detailing my after care was sent But when I raised this with my GP there was general non compression about what TV expected the surgery to do I was left hanging in the air and when an emergency arose neither GP nor supposedly specialist nurse knew what to do 4 Mostly those answering the phone do a good job especially the person who has been there the longest though occasionally messages get confused or are somehow lost in translation so to speak 5 Empathy can be taught The human element aids healing I once was with a GP who as I tried to explain some anxiety regarding my health was looking at their watch Givimng the impression as sub text please go as fast as you can is not good It is anti healing the most basic and worst mistake 6 I think patients such as myself should be invited in to give feedback and make constructive criticism on a regular basis Maybe a group of such people should meet occasionally with doctors cante wasteya Dr PERSON 19sept1945 poorwolf com 0207 [*PHONE*] PS= Some elderly patients will not have computers and will not be able to contact you online Some will not have the computer skills that my grand daughter had at 7 years of age,negative,0.6275842786,430.0,4.0,Follow-up and Continuity of Care,neutral,0,-0.6275842786

This practice used to be excellent but has deteriorated since 2020 The Practice Manager is Very good and rang me immediately after I complained to a doctor Main issues are 1 Inefficient reception staff Any time I phone there can be at least a 10 minute wait for an answer There were 4 at a recent visit but only one was dealing with patients the others were staring at screens Later there were SIX staff all looking confused On my last visit I heard a patient being told by the little Asian female receptionist that Chelsea Westminster Hospital was on Kings Rd I had to tell him the correct location 2 A plastic screen stands between staff and patients meaning neither side can hear properly without shouting often private details The screen has been dirty though it had been cleaned when I went yesterday maybe due to my comment to the Practice Manager It should be removed just causes frustration 3 There s not a feeling of respect by many staff just that you re an inconvenience 4 It s very hard to see a doctor face to face Phone appointments are inconvenient as there is no set time given in the day so very hard particularly if you re working,negative,0.86886704,207.0,3.0,Reception Staff Interaction,annoyance,0,-0.86886704

Getting an in person appointment is a rarity As a family we are in relative good health so we only go to the doctors when something really doesn t feel right Follow up is non existent unless initiated by oneself The doctor never follows up Test results are not related and unless something is out of the expected range there is no follow up to tell you about it or if the symptoms continue to discuss alternative routes of action When readings are slightly out of range doesnt appear to know how to interpret them and relies on the labs notes If a specialist appointment is suggested ALWAYS pushed down the private route despite the fact we no longer have private insurance and greatly discouraged of following the nhs route don t you read the press Delays are inormous in hospital referrals But that is perhaps our personal experience in particular with Dr PERSON My daughter was also diagnosed with faecal impaction at A E in C W We followed the protocol suggested and at that time there was a young doctor who helped tremendously She DID do follow ups In fact she scheduled them and would call in to check on progress Sadly the young lady left the practice very soon Before leaving she called us to let us know that she was leaving and to reassure us that she had discussed our case in details with the colleague that would be taking over No one from the practice ever called after this lady left What is chronic constipation that doesn t clear over a couple of months despite obscene doses of movicol in a child coupled with considerable weight loss Clearly an irrelevance to this practice or at least that is what you felt like Telephone appointments never run on time which is to be expected but if you miss the call after two rings forget the doctor calling you back you have to start a lengthy and convoluted chasing exercise You feel a mere number and an inconvenience at this surgery Certainly not a good patient experience The doctors appear not to care at all,negative,0.710640013,353.0,1.0,Follow-up and Continuity of Care,neutral,0,-0.710640013

Very very difficult to access help not their fault as I am aware how understaffed and busy they are but as someone who lives with a long term mental health condition being told constantly that things aren t possible is not easy The GP I spoke to recently was very nice and helpful as is the nurse I ve seen at the practice but reception staff have often given me the wrong information leading to a serious issue with medication or been very cold in manner which is off putting when trying to access help and support Whilst I appreciate that having online services makes things easier for the practice I feel that it is illogical to expect people to feel safe operating in this way when it comes to their health For me personally having a little more human contact and reassurance would go a long way to helping me manage my condition the best way I can,negative,0.8558592796,158.0,4.0,Reception Staff Interaction,approval,0,-0.8558592796

I think you have a good system generally the phone triage system does work well once you get through I d love to have been able to have spoken to a doctor on the same day with my 90 year old father in a practice in Herts so I do think that is good A ring back system on the phone line so that one does not have to wait to get through for an unknown period of time is needed You should be able to ring back numbers that elect for a call back It s really difficult if you are working and impossible for mothers with young children often to stay on the phone for that period of time often the children cut off the calls I am also uneasy how rarely one does get to see a Dr in person and I fear things don t necessarily get picked up the kind of things one mentions on the way out but which turn out to be important Just by looking at someone a good GP can tell a lot I also think it s not great if a patient has an issue such as depression but which they haven t identified themselves The times I have been very depressed have both been identified by two doctors outside the practice and they were right I appreciate resources are very stretched and I do think this is a good practice generally especially when compared with others,positive,0.852620542,245.0,4.0,Follow-up and Continuity of Care,admiration,0,0.852620542

I am EXTREMELY frustrated with who I think are the pharmacist doctors I get these annoying texts to submit my blood pressure reading I know my blood pressure is high I am working with a GP at Earls Court medical to get it under control If I input a high number I m told I urgently need to make an appointment with my GP which I have already done because we re monitoring my blood pressure closely Moreover the survey timing seems random and often wrong I was told I had two weeks to submit a reading I have that in writing but the survey expired after a week Finally I was supposed to be called by a pharmacist doctor to review my medication I cleared time on my schedule for this and nothing Clearly things aren t joined up and this is simply unacceptable I am a patient and a person I m not a box that can be ticked once a text has been sent to my phone This is no way to practice medicine It s striking there are amazing people like PERSON and Dr PERSON and Dr PERSON at ECMC and many of the receptionists are lovely too But the surgery s AI digital presence is dehumanising and so is the I who is requesting blood pressure readings from me,negative,0.8794519901,219.0,5.0,Follow-up and Continuity of Care,annoyance,0,-0.8794519901

I feel rather processed than listened to as a patient we have lost the GP patient relationship and it s quite sad it feels to me there is a loss of compassion among the Dr s most Good because they are overstretched or it might be generational Most have absolutely no idea about ones condition or couldn t be bothered reading ones history it feels impersonal and a waste of time doing a whole repetition of the problems one has as time is obviously limited it s also not holistic any more as you can only speak about one thing at a time Its not only in your health centre btw It seems rather systemic as I had a horrendous even dangerous experience while I was hospitalized recently the same for my partner who was just released from hospital there is a huge problem with communication and reporting it seems On a lighter note your reception staff has really stepped up and all for the better at least they know what they are doing now which wasn t the case months ago which was more than annoying Regarding the service you are providing it is prompt and reliable Look times have changed where your GP knew everything about you and your family and I was lucky to have had the privilege to experience a completely different approach to healthcare but those days a truly over and in my opinion it s a great shame,negative,0.8892633319,239.0,3.0,Reception Staff Interaction,sadness,0,-0.8892633319

My son was given an appointment from the doctor to go in for a full blood test after one initial blood test due to very low white blood cell which causes him weakness We waited patiently for the appointment and when the time comes the reception denies his blood test and told us to call the hospital instead because he is not fully 16years old I fully understand the rules but if under doctorâ€™s consideration he was given an appointment then he should get the test done instead of having to call the hospital Which we have to wait for further two weeks We could have called for the blood test directly at the hospital and get the test earlier than this if we were not told to wait for this appointment There are rules and there is common sense,negative,0.5607435703,140.0,2.0,Reception Staff Interaction,neutral,0,-0.5607435703

I wish there are follow ups by GP especially when tests are taken It is my understanding that a recently launched NHS App is expected to provide this function however the App is not working i e it only gives error messages every time I try to use any functions The waiting area of the practice is quite worn down which was noticed even by my kids None of my recent visits were on time even though I always come at least 5 minutes before my appointments GPs also seems to have limited tools available for them to perform basic tests they were able to perform in the past i e for example urine test analysis or swap tests etc It seems to be generally a very high rotation of GPs at the practice to the extend that regular patients have to retell their medical history i e no continuation or possibility to see the same doctor It used to be the same doctor for the entire family now there is no complete picture for any of the doctors to connect the dots if several members of the family have the same health issues,negative,0.747098446,191.0,3.0,Follow-up and Continuity of Care,desire,0,-0.747098446

Stanhope Mews was excellent very friendly and professional The GP referred me to the MSK service at Earls Court The specialist human there was also very friendly and professional but the system itself was dysfunctional changed appointments randomly without notification Fortunately the NHS humans simply accommodated the patient humans who routinely showed up at the wrong time The NHS human referred me to an online exercise class which sounded like a good idea The system then sent me several links usernames and passwords only one of which I used as the other was for the NHS app which I already have and I so did not want to overwrite my current NHS login information I signed up for an online exercise course via the first link sent still don t understand how the NHS app relates to this but it turns out it is an actual live appointment at 9 30am rather than an online video I could watch at any time so the timing is incredibly inconvenient it is at 2 30AM my current time At any rate it is unGood I will be able to attend regardless of time because there IS NO INFORMATION about how to access the class No link no description nothing I was hoping to get an email after I signed up with some instructions but nothing has arrived As I only have a time and date and no login information I have no idea how to attend this class So while I found the humans all trying to be helpful and nice the online system is hopeless,positive,0.7502212524,262.0,3.0,Staff Professionalism,disappointment,0,0.7502212524

I was sent a text message to inform me of an appointment set by dr PERSON to see me on the 5th I called the surgery following the text message to let them know I would be unable to attend as I was away on holiday and look to res schedule the appointment and find out the reason for it An alternative date could not be scheduled because the doctor had her books closed for the end of the month when I would be back in town When I asked what the reason for the appointment was the lady who had taken the call after reading my notes was unable to say as there seemed to be no details on my records as to what has prompted the unexpected appointment We agreed she would speak with the doctor to check and if a telephone appointment sufficed we would keep the appointment of the 5th and otherwise a new date would be booked for me I heard nothing further so I assumed I would get a phone call from the doc at the appointment time on the 5th The 5th came and there was no call or contact from my gp Next thing I know on the 6th I receive a feedback questionnaire to check how I would rate my visit I still don t know why the doctor wanted to see me despite me calling the surgery so as to not waste the docs appointments no such courtesy has been returned to me and I remain worried at what may have prompted the initial need for the dr PERSON to set an unexpected appointment I also don t know if a different appointment date has been set I recently had a scan and wondered if it may be related to the results of this It wouldn t have taken long for Dr PERSON to either call me or send me a message to let me know the reason for her unexpected desire to see me and if there was any need for concern or not,neutral,0.5508086085,341.0,1.0,Appointment Availability,confusion,0,0.5508086085

I am only giving this feedback because I was invited to do so and so I must speak the truth as I see it From a recent visitation to the clinic it gives me enough motivation to say this I believe the clinic has a responsibility to attend to the needs of their patients rather than to pre assume their needs I also believe that the role of a clinic is not just to tend to the sick but to also tend to the healthy so that the healthy remain healthy and the sick are cured and made healthy This makes the clinic a clinic for all people and a cornerstone for peopleâ€™s lives to show that a clinic cares for the patient regardless of how sick they are This build a strong foundation for a trusting and healthy society That is why I believe it is important for the clinic to allow general health examinations for healthy or sick patients where the goal is for the doctor to assess analyse and highlight any health problems concerns or issues that come up in tests or examinations of the patientâ€™s body which can include but not limited to tests that record the health of their organs general fitness assessment of fat storages sugar levels or any general precursor known through modern research to future illness There is a saying that goes that prevention is better than cure and we should strive to build a preventative clinic as well as a clinic that cures I trust the expertise of the doctors to find suitable tests for us instead of us needing to play the role of the doctor and ask the doctors for tests we are not educated about Please also recognise that in this scenario the patient may not be aware of any medical issues or conditions because it is the role of the doctor to tell the patient if there are health concerns or risks that they should look out for this could be diet fitness or even assessments of general muscular and spinal health I was appalled at the lack of knowledge surrounding preventative assessments we as patients do not wish to come to you when we are sick we would rather come to you healthy and have the doctor affirm and verify that there are no health concerns and we do not have to come back often I believe the management should be capable of figuring out time periods for patients so that a general health check up doesnâ€™t happen all the time The doctors also should know what Iâ€™m talking about I simply cannot believe that they are ignorant of what a general health and body examination is I believe that staff should learn to love one another as well as their patients to treat them with dignity and respect and unfortunately one doctor is ruining the reputation for all of you but I do not wish to give out names The staff should communicate with each other and show love and respect for one another and not to dismiss and ignore for we all share this broken world and we do not know when our time is up The staff should show love and respect to patients because they have placed their trust in you I do not believe it is helpful to portray patients in a negative light or to be judgemental of their background or assuming of where they come from We all want to build a positive and happy work environment that patients can see and staff can enjoy Management should be equipped with methods to do that I pray that future patients will not receive what I experienced because it can be very hurtful for those who are anxious about their health and I had anxiety attacks and heart palpitations for 4 hours after the consultation I do not wish to dig further into the session and pulling out examples and evidence to prove my point and pedantic about terminologies and truth conditions as I experienced in the clinic breaks trust and does not build rapport with patients because I see it as a form of interrogation and is unbecoming of a health clinic that is supposed to form positive and happy relationships with patients Putting patients on the spot to recall facts about their medical history to try and trip them in the session where the facts have already been disclosed shows a lack of trust and communication from staff and a hostile tone I hope that staff will be happy and motivated to be thoughtful advisory and honest about the medical status of patients showing patient care and their history with other doctors so they donâ€™t have to assess patients fresh and I pray that light will shine on Scarsdale to improve and that staff are happy and are friends with each other in their workplace It is hurtful for me to see staff that are unhappy because it makes me unhappy and it doesnâ€™t improve my mental health when I see doctors and staff who I look up to and respect who themselves seem to need medical attention I hope you will take this advice constructively and I do not wish to be confrontational at all God bless you and may better days come,neutral,0.579192698,885.0,2.0,Feedback and Complaints Handling,approval,0,0.579192698

I was able to secure an early appointment to see the doctor against a cancelled appointment vacated by another patient of the surgery The doctor heard me did some basic checks and ordered some tests to be done assured me that I would be sent to a specialist if there was a clear need to do so also assured me that things like overnight monitoring were possible if needed The medical tests blood and urine were then scheduled promptly by the staff However in my view the phlebolotomist on December 6th did not take samples as required for the tests ordered by the doctor I tried to check the list of tests ordered with the phlebolotomist hoping to prompt the phlebolotimist to confirm that the blood samples taken were adequate for the tests ordered however the phlebolotomist did not respond adequately to my expression of concern I lack the medical experience required to actually determine whether sufficient samples were being taken and so I withdrew my enquiry and did as was instructed Subsequently it was reported that one of the tests Hb1Ac could not be carried out for the lack of a proper sample Since I am pre diabetic this was an important test and I subsequently got it done privately in order to be ready for my chat with the doctor on December 16th I received good attention and care at the surgery however I am yet to get across all of my medical history to the doctor of which at my age there is a decent chunk I appreciate that this might be time consuming for a bit however it is a one time exercise,neutral,0.7789419293403625,275.0,3.0,Test Results,neutral,0,0.7789419293403625

I have overall been pleased with my experience at the practice since switching not long ago I understood in the context of my discussion with he who saw me most recently that he is not a consultant at the practice but was in for coverage outside regular hours Perhaps the feedback is in that case less relevant but I still wanted to pass it on I gather his review of me for my most immediate concern was thorough with regard to vitals and symptoms but I would say I found engagement with him unpleasant Especially as concerns an attempt to liaise regarding a broader concern to that of the most immediate symptoms I understood from him by the end the concern may be best taken up with a regular resident at the practice but only after I sought for a decent amount of time to broach the topic with him in what became a progressively frustrating exchange I do understand that bed side manner so to speak can vary but I found the tone to be somewhat aloof and dismissive and left with an unpleasant feeling about the whole thing by the end Given I know that I do not raise concerns frivolously it was unfortunate I have been fortunate to have had many good experiences with GP s especially in the UK but like most I am sure have also had these experiences where one does not feel pleasant about the interaction and I think they are important to flag when they occur,positive,0.8202123045921326,253.0,3.0,Feedback and Complaints Handling,annoyance,0,0.8202123045921326
