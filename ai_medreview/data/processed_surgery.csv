Some doctors have refused my request for follow-up scans. They may have a reason but the patient would feel more at ease mentally maybe having a second scan.

Below some comments, I am not complaining, jsut want to share some feedback if this can help in any ways to further improve.","I have shared some comments with Doctor Pumphrey who suggested I request a feedback form. I wanted to share some past experiences with her as I think a few things sometime undermine the work done by GPs. I am not complaining here, just want to be constructive and support the best I can public health services. A couple of examples, lat year I due to have a blood pressure monitoring. The Pharmacist (Michelle Chai) was due to send the links 2 weeks later. After 3 weeks as no news I contacted the medical center to talk to her. The answer was ""she is gone"". The way I've been told that was very much ""she's been fired"". Not good. Very negative impact. Then a few months later, I was due to have 2 test together with a PSA test. When I have enquired results of the PSA test the answer was : ""2 tests have been done but the PSA. Doctor Robertson singed a new form"" That's it....A bit harsh. Not good and very much like ""no ones care"" ! Recently, mid April I've got a message from Doctor Kamvari about smoking and the suggestion to take an appointment with the smoking advisor. I've answered I would dur it beginning of May. End of April I went to the Medical Center to have an appointment. Answer ""We no longer do it. Look at the government website !"" Not helpful. I sent a message to Doctor Kamvari, no answer ! This is a pity as these do not reflect the work done by the GPs and give a negative image of Kensington Medical Park Center.

The consultant said a GP needed to see me and booked an appointment for me in the morning. However, the surgery phoned me in the morning to retriage me and the GP diagnosed me on the phone. As a result, first I ended up vomiting trying to get a picture of the back of my throat and second, the doctor did not listen to my check. As a result, I had to phone back the following day, and a second GP finally agreed to see me but dismissed my concerns about my cough. I then had to come back a third time and then he confirmed my suspicions of bronchitis and prescribed steroids for it, which are really helping now. 

I wish the GP had seen me on the first occasion, as recommended by the 111 consultant and maybe I would have been cured faster. Plus, the surgery would have saved time, seeing me only once instead of three times.

I don't mind phone appointment, but when one is really sick, the GP needs to see the person as it is not possible to diagnose without taking measurements et observing properly the patient.

Lastly, this doesn't concern the practice but the 111 service asked me to choose a symptom to treat, which is a strange thing to ask as how can one diagnose a patient based on one symptom ?",Brompton-Health-PCN,Kensington-Park-Medical-Centre
