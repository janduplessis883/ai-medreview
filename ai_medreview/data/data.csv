02/03/2024 16:25,Likely,I joined the Redcliffe Surgery in 1965 That is nearly 60 years ago The current ethos has lost the human ethos of yesteryear partly for reasons that cannot be overcome in the present situation of massive underfunding of the NHS the stupidity of Brexit ever more pressure from ever more patients and much else I know it is harder and harder BUT if you want to improve there is room for improvement 1 My wife is almost 102 years of age I think anyone 80 yrs and more the genuine elderlies need much more careful watching and monitoring especially in regards to the need for follow up Things that a specialist might ask the surgery to do are not done as if the message never got through The follow up in the surgery needs improving more generally 2 It is often necessary to follow up with one s GP and getting through to them can feel like too many hoops to jump If I have a blood test and get a very technical feedback I won t understand it The GP out to explain a complicated list of outcomes automatically 3 I have been seen over months by the Tissue Viability department at St Charles When no longer seen by them they claimed a letter to my surgery detailing my after care was sent But when I raised this with my GP there was general non compression about what TV expected the surgery to do I was left hanging in the air and when an emergency arose neither GP nor supposedly specialist nurse knew what to do 4 Mostly those answering the phone do a good job especially the person who has been there the longest though occasionally messages get confused or are somehow lost in translation so to speak 5 Empathy can be taught The human element aids healing I once was with a GP who as I tried to explain some anxiety regarding my health was looking at their watch Givimng the impression as sub text please go as fast as you can is not good It is anti healing the most basic and worst mistake 6 I think patients such as myself should be invited in to give feedback and make constructive criticism on a regular basis Maybe a group of such people should meet occasionally with doctors cante wasteya Dr PERSON 19sept1945 poorwolf com 0207 370 3654 PS= Some elderly patients will not have computers and will not be able to contact you online Some will not have the computer skills that my grand daughter had at 7 years of age,,Health Partners @ Violet Melchett,Brompton Health PCN,negative,0.6275838613510132,neutral,0,430,0,4,Follow-up and Continuity of Care,
