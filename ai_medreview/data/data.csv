2024-02-29 19:40:55,Likely,PERSON is the best she was extremely supportive and kind throughout my appointment Dr PERSON was also amazing with my partner for his appointment However my appointment with Dr PERSON was not good and I don t feel comfortable talking to her again she started off our appointment with incorrect assumptions that I was privately diagnosed with ADHD but she had my diagnosis letter up on her screen with the NHS logo in the corner and it also explains in the first few lines that it is Right To Choose she immediately went on to mention the influx of private diagnoses and the BBC panorama whilst I understand her concerns her approach was not a good one at all and showed heavy skepticism which immediately make me uncomfortable I was caught off guard and did get a little emotional but not massively whilst she did backtrack from this once I explained how ADHD affects my life which is why I got emotional how it is harmful for her as a clinician to take the approach she is taking especially largely quoting a very damaging sensationalist TV program as opposed to reliable sources and how frustrating it is to have waited for so long to be diagnosed to be told that I may not be able to get medication when it isn t our fault as patients that the ADHD waiting lists are so long I wouldn t mind doing a regular NHS assessment but the issue is that we can t access them not that we as patients don t want to and are choosing to pay for a diagnosis which I didn t anyhow I do sympathise with her concerns and understand as a clinician she should raise any concerns she has my problem is that she didn t take an open minded curious approach and on top of that when I later read her notes on my record I realised that she has gotten the details largely incorrect facts she recorded about my life as well as recording that I was upset that she needed to discuss things between the team which isn t the case at all I was only upset about the approach having being caught off guard and frustrated by the ADHD system overall given how massively it impacts my life A more kind curious and sympathetic approach would have been appreciated and I don t feel that referring to the panorama is very appropriate as a source of information given the issues with the reporting I feel uncomfortable asking to correct the notes because I don t want to come across as difficult or pedantic or for it to have a negative impact on my relationship with the practice or my future care I have had largely positive interactions with the NHS but the negative ones including a previous misdiagnosis where the clinician ignored my concerns have had a damaging impact on my confidence in the healthcare system and made me rather reluctant to engage with it I try not to be cynical but it feels hard to advocate for yourself as a patient and it s also been very difficult to access treatment aside from Right to Choose not in terms of referrals because I ve not experienced any issues there at all my past GP was great with this I haven t yet needed any at The Chelsea Practice but in terms of waiting lists it feels a little pointless to try,,The-Chelsea-Practice,Brompton-Health-PCN,positive,0.3565507233142853,neutral,0.0,565.0,0,4.0,Waiting Time,,,,"[0.9769898653030396, 0.871930718421936, 0.9879277348518372, 0, -0.8322610259056091, 0, -0.5813891291618347, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.9113384485244751, -0.8402137160301208, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.8484969139099121, 0, -0.917708158493042, -0.5164756178855896, -0.8847331404685974, 0, -0.6390959024429321, -0.6547685861587524, 0, 0.5408862233161926, -0.5278249382972717, 0, -0.6832758784294128, 0, 0, 0, -0.5801991820335388, -0.6409429311752319, 0, 0, 0, -0.7167868614196777, -0.8079276084899902, 0, 0, -0.642393946647644, -0.697780966758728, -0.6979793310165405, 0.5667912364006042, 0.6948821544647217, 0, 0, -0.8857877850532532, 0, -0.6617183089256287, -0.5087502598762512, 0, 0.804991602897644, 0, -0.6617619395256042, -0.7934381365776062, 0.5900536179542542, -0.6014094352722168, -0.5675830841064453, 0, -0.8365570306777954, 0, 0, 0, 0.7552160024642944, 0, -0.5577972531318665, -0.6557919383049011]",[0]

2024-05-20 17:42:26,Don't know,It s difficult because my last most recent appointment was regarding my mental health annual review and it was partly regarding another referral to CMHT there have been four referrals in the last six months and these approaches have not been met satisfactorily CMHT not supporting me The GP who saw me listened carefully and was polite but when I said that I need urgently to move he said it was not his designated remit though he didn t say it in these words to support me in this area So I felt that it s become a bit of a stalemate When CMHT never appears to support me who am I supposed to contact,At present yet another referral is awaiting processing I had to go to a community event attended by the police recently and requested they visit me as I am sure surveillance equipment is in my flat put there by psychopathic stalkers the police came at the weekend saying CMHt is due to come out to see me I told them the team had told me I had an upcoming appointment at Violett melchett with Dr PERSON but today I still had not received text confirmation So I called the GP reception and PERSON the receptionist said he would email and or phone to see if my appointment is going ahead on the 23rd I feel that the GPs should emphatically recontact the team to demand that I am seen instead of being led up the garden path with no follow ups and confirmations I feel threatened foreign enemy powers are controlling my computers and CMHT should do what they promised to do e g give me an appointment on 23rd as they said to me last week with the consultant dr PERSON,Health-Partners-at-Violet-Melchett,Brompton-Health-PCN,negative,0.8220186233520508,negative,0.5791338086128235,112.0,180,,Mental Health Support,Reception Staff Interaction,d8444N,JL0xdX,"[-0.672339916229248, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.6695601940155029, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.9047595262527466, 0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, -0.6795146465301514, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.8127377033233643, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
