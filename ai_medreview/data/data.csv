2024-06-15 23:02:59,Neither good nor poor,I feel misunderstood and uncared for by my main Dr After having spoken to her felt very sad distressed anxious and upset She is nervous and impatient with me despite she is aware of my vulnerabilities and mental health problems she triggers them even more I wait for months and weeks to talk to her two mins over the phone and all she does is hang up the phone on me not even giving me a chance to let me say what I have to say and English is not my first language and I have EUPD and other emotional dis regulations and traumatic stress related mental struggles She is always antagonising fighting me expect me to do all by myself even the referrals which need to be done by a Dr Even I spoke to South Kensington Chelsea CMHT Hounslow East MINT which told me my Dr should be helping me to get what I need and that I should not be chasing them myself The reality is that I need a Dr referral and the referral has to be done properly and chased up She is not even taking sufficient time and patience to understand and come towards my needs Everybody I talk to rely so much on their Drs and tell me stories how their Drs turned things around for them I do know that my Dr wrote only things that were unhelpful to make things worse for me to so that my charges would not get dropped she wrote I have no problems because my conditions are not causing me any problems and she is no psychiatrist no cardiologist and no diabetic consultant to state any of that And after all wonder if you can help someone a good person why would you not It is absolutely reprovable Even when she does a referral she is doing the least she can to properly allow a communication to understand what is going on what support I need and why I was trying to tell her the council is not providing me the help because it has to come from mental health and the nurse from mental health which was at the care act assessment said I have no mental problems which is not true so now they said it is my Dr that should have a say My Dr is telling me I can self refer that is not true she is lying I cannot self refer to see a consultant to have a clinician coordinator social worker you cannot I referred myself to a social worker but they said it has to come from CMHT which I cannot self refer I am not sure if I am being played around but this is what they said at RBKC council social services I think the council social services and my Dr both should ensure I get the support I need from mental health She is not helping me to get any NHS psychological therapies she refuses me a social prescriber which I need she is not referring me to a mental health clinician social worker She is not even referring me to see a consultant and she is not taking time to comprehend how much and what I am struggling with Since I am with this Dr she has done nothing for me because the referral needs to be done properly extensively explained then chased up With my previous Dr I always had therapies even when out of community he would get me to go at Community Living Well not letting me self refer so they reject me he would do the referral for me always and so he had referred ne to have a social worker which I did have for two years in the past from RBKC he would always do referrals for me always And whilst in temporary accomodation in supported home ge got me under CMHT for psychotherapy for one years This Dr has done nothing for me I am a good woman which should be helped She thinks I am getting the right therapies at the women s centre and with the Samaritans She must be joking I am feeling very very unwell mentally suffering past trauma and so much stress day after day because of the abuse I suffered at the hands of the police over the years and she has not even written an helping letter to my legal no Dr would ever do that She wrote everything is fine I have no issue if you can help a patient to overcome the deepest social injustices why would you not Even the referral for cardiology I explained to her patients are able to choose what hospital to attend and I attended Cardiology at Brompton Chelsea Westminstee and Charing Cross before even St Charles Community Hospital told me it is not true the Dr cannot refer me to my hospital of choice or an hospital which is closer to me I lost my appointments because they were given to me with little no notice on days I could not go and was not even able to tell her this because the hang up the phone on me whilst I was talking to her,Certainly it would have helped me to be with a different Dr like Dr PERSON but Dr PERSON control everything over my medical matters so the other Drs at the practice cannot do anything in terms of pursuing any of my referrals It would also help to have a choice on what hospital to attend or what course of treatment and support is best for me like I used to Not just assume the Samaritans or St Charles Community Hospital suffice my needs whether they are mental or physical Also would help meeting face to face having not so rushed appointments being calm and patient having a chance and enough time to speak and having some support with me whilst I speak like a

2024-06-25 06:50:56,Don't know,My GP said would have followed up the transfer of care from Hounslow East Mint as well do a new referral to South West London CMHT however as I spoke to SPA today they told me no referral has ever been received from my GP I need to be under a CPA Care Programm Approach Programm with a keyworker and a care coordinator This is specific for people with mental health problems personality disorders complex needs etc as well homeless in temporary accomodation I am meant to get this since 2020 my keyworker in supported home was following up on this but then I was evicted from the said home as I suffered criminal charges whilst living there The GP must do an URGENT referral for me to be under a Care Programme Approach or equivalent level of care and coordination so that I can discuss my needs with my local CMHT teams receive the right level of care and support and move on accordingly SW CMHT have to stop saying when I have a permanent hone I will be supported by them as that is also what the CPA or equivalent level of care is there for to also help people move on To be honest I should have got it back in 2017 when I initially became homeless At the moment I am being treated as if I have no needs no support in place and no move on points so that I can get appropriate place to suit my mental and physical needs After 6 years of homelessness I should not be forced to be moved into an unsuitable permanent accomodation to then start all over again a move on scheme especially as permanent homes needs repairs work and furnishing I cannot cope with that twice after all I have already been put through nobody should Also I was to get this level of care in Hounslow as I had a move on clinician and a liason nurse there however their transfer of care also does not appear to have been received and needs to be chased up by my GP I need to understand why my referral to be under a CPA was not made by my GP and if made what was the outcome in writing as we will need to complain to the Ombusdman health if rejected,The referral being urgently made as promised because now since Hounslow discharged me my care plan has been unfairly interrupted Also receive more regular at least weekly follow ups from my GP on the progress of my care referral or at least from the practice receptionists or manager in charge I need to be kept up to date regularly on what is going on with my care referrals,Emperors-Gate-Health-Centre,Brompton-Health-PCN,neutral,0.7730178237,neutral,0.5185340047,393.0,68,,Follow-up and Continuity of Care,Follow-up and Continuity of Care,GbdVo2,8PNorA,neutral,neutral,,,,,,,"{'score': 0.06212841346859932, 'start': 176, 'end': 210, 'answer': 'no referral has ever been received'}","{'score': 0.022212523967027664, 'start': 134, 'end': 181, 'answer': 'receive more regular at least weekly follow ups'}"

2024-08-21 17:33:00,Poor,I am only giving this feedback because I was invited to do so and so I must speak the truth as I see it From a recent visitation to the clinic it gives me enough motivation to say this I believe the clinic has a responsibility to attend to the needs of their patients rather than to pre assume their needs I also believe that the role of a clinic is not just to tend to the sick but to also tend to the healthy so that the healthy remain healthy and the sick are cured and made healthy This makes the clinic a clinic for all people and a cornerstone for people√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s lives to show that a clinic cares for the patient regardless of how sick they are This build a strong foundation for a trusting and healthy society That is why I believe it is important for the clinic to allow general health examinations for healthy or sick patients where the goal is for the doctor to assess analyse and highlight any health problems concerns or issues that come up in tests or examinations of the patient√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s body which can include but not limited to tests that record the health of their organs general fitness assessment of fat storages sugar levels or any general precursor known through modern research to future illness There is a saying that goes that prevention is better than cure and we should strive to build a preventative clinic as well as a clinic that cures I trust the expertise of the doctors to find suitable tests for us instead of us needing to play the role of the doctor and ask the doctors for tests we are not educated about Please also recognise that in this scenario the patient may not be aware of any medical issues or conditions because it is the role of the doctor to tell the patient if there are health concerns or risks that they should look out for this could be diet fitness or even assessments of general muscular and spinal health I was appalled at the lack of knowledge surrounding preventative assessments we as patients do not wish to come to you when we are sick we would rather come to you healthy and have the doctor affirm and verify that there are no health concerns and we do not have to come back often I believe the management should be capable of figuring out time periods for patients so that a general health check up doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t happen all the time The doctors also should know what I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m talking about I simply cannot believe that they are ignorant of what a general health and body examination is I believe that staff should learn to love one another as well as their patients to treat them with dignity and respect and unfortunately one doctor is ruining the reputation for all of you but I do not wish to give out names The staff should communicate with each other and show love and respect for one another and not to dismiss and ignore for we all share this broken world and we do not know when our time is up The staff should show love and respect to patients because they have placed their trust in you I do not believe it is helpful to portray patients in a negative light or to be judgemental of their background or assuming of where they come from We all want to build a positive and happy work environment that patients can see and staff can enjoy Management should be equipped with methods to do that I pray that future patients will not receive what I experienced because it can be very hurtful for those who are anxious about their health and I had anxiety attacks and heart palpitations for 4 hours after the consultation I do not wish to dig further into the session and pulling out examples and evidence to prove my point and pedantic about terminologies and truth conditions as I experienced in the clinic breaks trust and does not build rapport with patients because I see it as a form of interrogation and is unbecoming of a health clinic that is supposed to form positive and happy relationships with patients Putting patients on the spot to recall facts about their medical history to try and trip them in the session where the facts have already been disclosed shows a lack of trust and communication from staff and a hostile tone I hope that staff will be happy and motivated to be thoughtful advisory and honest about the medical status of patients showing patient care and their history with other doctors so they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to assess patients fresh and I pray that light will shine on Scarsdale to improve and that staff are happy and are friends with each other in their workplace It is hurtful for me to see staff that are unhappy because it makes me unhappy and it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t improve my mental health when I see doctors and staff who I look up to and respect who themselves seem to need medical attention I hope you will take this advice constructively and I do not wish to be confrontational at all God bless you and may better days
