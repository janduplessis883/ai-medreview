2024-02-16 11:02:00,Neither likely nor unlikely,I have not had a recent appointmen but I thought I would answer anyway My experience is that when I need a doctor I find it hard to get an appointment unless urgent I need to have a telephone consultation first I was once told I think it was for a persistent and annoying cough that I had had for months after a laryngitis and I wanted to know if there was a cough medicine I could take I was told I should go to A and E but it was not THAT urgent I just needed advice I was quite disappointed and then went to a private GP She saw me the day afterwards scheduled a chest Xray and got me a prescription Also some friends of my age we are all oldies get check ups by their GP but so far I have had to ask for blood tests sometimes asked for by my cardiologist sometimes because I felt a long time had gone by I am aware that COVID has been very detrimental for everybody patients and doctors from many points of view and my problems are minor compared to others However as a result I am stuck seeing a private dermatologist My check ups for a suspicious mole on my back I live alone and have no way to check this myself were continuously cancelled or postponed but I needed it to be seen on consultant s advice in three months Admittedly this was not the GP it was the hospital Now I would be happy to see the GP for regular check ups rather than going to the private consultations So it would be useful to have a regular check up that is my point I have been seen by different doctors not often and they were very nice and one in particular was helpful getting me quick appointments for my thyroid problem I have been impressed with the notices I receive for vaccinations and general information like recently when I was given a possibility to be checked for atrial fibrillation I would have come but was out of the country The staff at the reception is always helpful and kind,I think maybe that the distinction in urgent and non urgent can be off putting when one just maybe needs reassurance or advice and does want to wait two weeks to talk to a doctor What is considered urgent It is really all relative and especially when one is older and lives alone Maybe I was unlucky but now I hesitate calling Thank you for giving me the opportunity to express my experience I know I need to be thankful that I have access to care at all,Stanhope-Mews-Surgery,Brompton-Health-PCN,negative,0.5672797560691833,neutral,0.5987886190414429,365.0,88,3.0,Appointment Availability,Patient Respect,,,disappointment,gratitude

2024-02-16 11:38:00,Neither likely nor unlikely,I spent less than 10 minutes with the Doctor I had 3 easy questions and on the 3rd question the Doctor says to me this will have to be your last question I had not taken much of her time and yet she seemed annoyed by the amount of enquiry i put forth She mentioned that her prior patients had asked too many questions Later i thought no wonder people are asking so many questions it s so difficult to get an appointment to see a doctor i wasn t there is a limit to how many questions a patient is permitted to ask Maybe she was just having a bad day In which case i understand because it happens,The NHS and Doctors are under tremendous strain so i appreciate the fact that i was able to receive help I guess i just wanted to feel like the Doctor realised how much we patients appreciate them Instead i got the impression i had somehow annoyed her Again though we all have bad days so it s ok,Stanhope-Mews-Surgery,Brompton-Health-PCN,negative,0.5102756023406982,neutral,0.3730044662952423,121.0,57,3.0,Appointment Availability,Patient Respect,,,neutral,realization

2024-02-29 12:21:00,Unlikely,I have recently moved to the area from Australia and registered at this practice I was needed a repeat prescription for a medication I have been on for around 5 years I was given a phone appointment which is ok however as I have never been to the practice nor ever been to a gp in the uk I was expecting to have an in person appointment I was lucky to get a same day phone appointment The problems started while on the phone to the gp stated they don t often prescribe the medication I am usually on but could give be a months dose and gave me a list of alternative medications My concern is that this medication is an antidepressants that I have been stable on for 5 years From my understanding the practice and gps do not want to prescribe me the medication as it cost the practice more than alternatives which have not worked for me the past The gp is putting their need wants ahead of the patient that they are meant to be caring for If the practice refuses to continue to prescribe this medication for me I will have to look into a private go which as a nurse working in the nhs is not an sustainable option for me,,Health-Partners-at-Violet-Melchett,Brompton-Health-PCN,neutral,0.7320456504821777,neutral,0.0,217.0,0,2.0,Prescriptions and Medication Management,,,,neutral,

2024-03-02 16:25:00,Likely,I joined the Redcliffe Surgery in 1965 That is nearly 60 years ago The current ethos has lost the human ethos of yesteryear partly for reasons that cannot be overcome in the present situation of massive underfunding of the NHS the stupidity of Brexit ever more pressure from ever more patients and much else I know it is harder and harder BUT if you want to improve there is room for improvement 1 My wife is almost 102 years of age I think anyone 80 yrs and more the genuine elderlies need much more careful watching and monitoring especially in regards to the need for follow up Things that a specialist might ask the surgery to do are not done as if the message never got through The follow up in the surgery needs improving more generally 2 It is often necessary to follow up with one s GP and getting through to them can feel like too many hoops to jump If I have a blood test and get a very technical feedback I won t understand it The GP out to explain a complicated list of outcomes automatically 3 I have been seen over months by the Tissue Viability department at St Charles When no longer seen by them they claimed a letter to my surgery detailing my after care was sent But when I raised this with my GP there was general non compression about what TV expected the surgery to do I was left hanging in the air and when an emergency arose neither GP nor supposedly specialist nurse knew what to do 4 Mostly those answering the phone do a good job especially the person who has been there the longest though occasionally messages get confused or are somehow lost in translation so to speak 5 Empathy can be taught The human element aids healing I once was with a GP who as I tried to explain some anxiety regarding my health was looking at their watch Givimng the impression as sub text please go as fast as you can is not good It is anti healing the most basic and worst mistake 6 I think patients such as myself should be invited in to give feedback and make constructive criticism on a regular basis Maybe a group of such people should meet occasionally with doctors cante wasteya Dr PERSON 19sept1945 poorwolf com 0207 [*PHONE*] PS= Some elderly patients will not have computers and will not be able to contact you online Some will not have the computer skills that my grand daughter had at 7 years of age,,Health-Partners-at-Violet-Melchett,Brompton-Health-PCN,negative,0.6275842785835266,neutral,0.0,430.0,0,4.0,Follow-up and Continuity of Care,,,,neutral,

2024-04-10 02:37:00,Unlikely,I recently had a rather disappointing experience with the appointment scheduling at Green Meadows GP Surgery Despite the convenience of online booking the available slots are as rare as a sunny day in midwinter I ve found myself in a perpetual race against the clock and countless others all competing for the next available opening which to my dismay is typically weeks away This scarcity of appointments becomes particularly vexing when dealing with acute conditions that require timely attention The notion of seeing your GP today seems like an old folktale retold by those who remember a time before the days of jammed phone lines and the seemingly endless loop of hold music that has become the hallmark of my attempts to reach the surgery,Furthermore the system in place seems to have little consideration for those with inflexible work hours On the rare occasion when an appointment does materialize it s often at the most inconvenient of times tucked in the middle of a weekday Attempting to reschedule is an ordeal in itself met with a sigh from the receptionist and a reminder of their cancellation policy It s disheartening really when the struggle to simply book an appointment overshadows the medical concern itself The process leaves much to be desired and has unfortunately eroded my trust in the system s capacity to provide care when it s most needed,Demo-Surgery-1,Demo-PCN,negative,0.8220332264900208,negative,0.826546311,124.0,102,2.0,Appointment Availability,Appointment Availability,GY55NL,ZVAZ5e,disappointment,sadness

2024-05-20 17:42:00,Don't know,It s difficult because my last most recent appointment was regarding my mental health annual review and it was partly regarding another referral to CMHT there have been four referrals in the last six months and these approaches have not been met satisfactorily CMHT not supporting me The GP who saw me listened carefully and was polite but when I said that I need urgently to move he said it was not his designated remit though he didn t say it in these words to support me in this area So I felt that it s become a bit of a stalemate When CMHT never appears to support me who am I supposed to contact,At present yet another referral is awaiting processing I had to go to a community event attended by the police recently and requested they visit me as I am sure surveillance equipment is in my flat put there by psychopathic stalkers the police came at the weekend saying CMHt is due to come out to see me I told them the team had told me I had an upcoming appointment at Violett melchett with Dr PERSON but today I still had not received text confirmation So I called the GP reception and PERSON the receptionist said he would email and or phone to see if my appointment is going ahead on the 23rd I feel that the GPs should emphatically recontact the team to demand that I am seen instead of being led up the garden path with no follow ups and confirmations I feel threatened foreign enemy powers are controlling my computers and CMHT should do what they promised to do e g give me an appointment on 23rd as they said to me last week with the consultant dr PERSON,Health-Partners-at-Violet-Melchett,Brompton-Health-PCN,negative,0.8220186233520508,negative,0.5791338086128235,112.0,180,,Mental Health Support,Reception Staff Interaction,d8444N,JL0xdX,disappointment,neutral

2024-06-15 23:02:59,Neither likely nor unlikely,I feel misunderstood and uncared for by my main Dr After having spoken to her felt very sad distressed anxious and upset She is nervous and impatient with me despite she is aware of my vulnerabilities and mental health problems she triggers them even more I wait for months and weeks to talk to her two mins over the phone and all she does is hang up the phone on me not even giving me a chance to let me say what I have to say and English is not my first language and I have EUPD and other emotional dis regulations and traumatic stress related mental struggles She is always antagonising fighting me expect me to do all by myself even the referrals which need to be done by a Dr Even I spoke to South Kensington Chelsea CMHT Hounslow East MINT which told me my Dr should be helping me to get what I need and that I should not be chasing them myself The reality is that I need a Dr referral and the referral has to be done properly and chased up She is not even taking sufficient time and patience to understand and come towards my needs Everybody I talk to rely so much on their Drs and tell me stories how their Drs turned things around for them I do know that my Dr wrote only things that were unhelpful to make things worse for me to so that my charges would not get dropped she wrote I have no problems because my conditions are not causing me any problems and she is no psychiatrist no cardiologist and no diabetic consultant to state any of that And after all wonder if you can help someone a good person why would you not It is absolutely reprovable Even when she does a referral she is doing the least she can to properly allow a communication to understand what is going on what support I need and why I was trying to tell her the council is not providing me the help because it has to come from mental health and the nurse from mental health which was at the care act assessment said I have no mental problems which is not true so now they said it is my Dr that should have a say My Dr is telling me I can self refer that is not true she is lying I cannot self refer to see a consultant to have a clinician coordinator social worker you cannot I referred myself to a social worker but they said it has to come from CMHT which I cannot self refer I am not sure if I am being played around but this is what they said at RBKC council social services I think the council social services and my Dr both should ensure I get the support I need from mental health She is not helping me to get any NHS psychological therapies she refuses me a social prescriber which I need she is not referring me to a mental health clinician social worker She is not even referring me to see a consultant and she is not taking time to comprehend how much and what I am struggling with Since I am with this Dr she has done nothing for me because the referral needs to be done properly extensively explained then chased up With my previous Dr I always had therapies even when out of community he would get me to go at Community Living Well not letting me self refer so they reject me he would do the referral for me always and so he had referred ne to have a social worker which I did have for two years in the past from RBKC he would always do referrals for me always And whilst in temporary accomodation in supported home ge got me under CMHT for psychotherapy for one years This Dr has done nothing for me I am a good woman which should be helped She thinks I am getting the right therapies at the women s centre and with the Samaritans She must be joking I am feeling very very unwell mentally suffering past trauma and so much stress day after day because of the abuse I suffered at the hands of the police over the years and she has not even written an helping letter to my legal no Dr would ever do that She wrote everything is fine I have no issue if you can help a patient to overcome the deepest social injustices why would you not Even the referral for cardiology I explained to her patients are able to choose what hospital to attend and I attended Cardiology at Brompton Chelsea Westminstee and Charing Cross before even St Charles Community Hospital told me it is not true the Dr cannot refer me to my hospital of choice or an hospital which is closer to me I lost my appointments because they were given to me with little no notice on days I could not go and was not even able to tell her this because the hang up the phone on me whilst I was talking to her,Certainly it would have helped me to be with a different Dr like Dr PERSON but Dr PERSON control everything over my medical matters so the other Drs at the practice cannot do anything in terms of pursuing any of my referrals It would also help to have a choice on what hospital to attend or what course of treatment and support is best for me like I used to Not just assume the Samaritans or St Charles Community Hospital suffice my needs whether they are mental or physical Also would help meeting face to face having not so rushed appointments being calm and patient having a chance and enough time to speak and having some support with me whilst I speak like a social prescriber a support or social worker or a mental health advocate,Emperors-Gate-Health-Centre,Brompton-Health-PCN,negative,0.9248549342155457,neutral,0.6842193603515625,878.0,136,3.0,Feedback and Complaints Handling,Mental Health
