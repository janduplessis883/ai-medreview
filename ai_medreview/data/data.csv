2024-02-16 11:02:00,Neither likely nor unlikely,I have not had a recent appointmen but I thought I would answer anyway My experience is that when I need a doctor I find it hard to get an appointment unless urgent I need to have a telephone consultation first I was once told I think it was for a persistent and annoying cough that I had had for months after a laryngitis and I wanted to know if there was a cough medicine I could take I was told I should go to A and E but it was not THAT urgent I just needed advice I was quite disappointed and then went to a private GP She saw me the day afterwards scheduled a chest Xray and got me a prescription Also some friends of my age we are all oldies get check ups by their GP but so far I have had to ask for blood tests sometimes asked for by my cardiologist sometimes because I felt a long time had gone by I am aware that COVID has been very detrimental for everybody patients and doctors from many points of view and my problems are minor compared to others However as a result I am stuck seeing a private dermatologist My check ups for a suspicious mole on my back I live alone and have no way to check this myself were continuously cancelled or postponed but I needed it to be seen on consultant s advice in three months Admittedly this was not the GP it was the hospital Now I would be happy to see the GP for regular check ups rather than going to the private consultations So it would be useful to have a regular check up that is my point I have been seen by different doctors not often and they were very nice and one in particular was helpful getting me quick appointments for my thyroid problem I have been impressed with the notices I receive for vaccinations and general information like recently when I was given a possibility to be checked for atrial fibrillation I would have come but was out of the country The staff at the reception is always helpful and kind,I think maybe that the distinction in urgent and non urgent can be off putting when one just maybe needs reassurance or advice and does want to wait two weeks to talk to a doctor What is considered urgent It is really all relative and especially when one is older and lives alone Maybe I was unlucky but now I hesitate calling Thank you for giving me the opportunity to express my experience I know I need to be thankful that I have access to care at all,Stanhope-Mews-Surgery,Brompton-Health-PCN,negative,0.5672797560691833,neutral,0.5987886190414429,365.0,88,3.0,Appointment Availability,Patient Respect,,

2024-02-29 19:40:00,Likely,PERSON is the best she was extremely supportive and kind throughout my appointment Dr PERSON was also amazing with my partner for his appointment However my appointment with Dr PERSON was not good and I don t feel comfortable talking to her again she started off our appointment with incorrect assumptions that I was privately diagnosed with ADHD but she had my diagnosis letter up on her screen with the NHS logo in the corner and it also explains in the first few lines that it is Right To Choose she immediately went on to mention the influx of private diagnoses and the BBC panorama whilst I understand her concerns her approach was not a good one at all and showed heavy skepticism which immediately make me uncomfortable I was caught off guard and did get a little emotional but not massively whilst she did backtrack from this once I explained how ADHD affects my life which is why I got emotional how it is harmful for her as a clinician to take the approach she is taking especially largely quoting a very damaging sensationalist TV program as opposed to reliable sources and how frustrating it is to have waited for so long to be diagnosed to be told that I may not be able to get medication when it isn t our fault as patients that the ADHD waiting lists are so long I wouldn t mind doing a regular NHS assessment but the issue is that we can t access them not that we as patients don t want to and are choosing to pay for a diagnosis which I didn t anyhow I do sympathise with her concerns and understand as a clinician she should raise any concerns she has my problem is that she didn t take an open minded curious approach and on top of that when I later read her notes on my record I realised that she has gotten the details largely incorrect facts she recorded about my life as well as recording that I was upset that she needed to discuss things between the team which isn t the case at all I was only upset about the approach having being caught off guard and frustrated by the ADHD system overall given how massively it impacts my life A more kind curious and sympathetic approach would have been appreciated and I don t feel that referring to the panorama is very appropriate as a source of information given the issues with the reporting I feel uncomfortable asking to correct the notes because I don t want to come across as difficult or pedantic or for it to have a negative impact on my relationship with the practice or my future care I have had largely positive interactions with the NHS but the negative ones including a previous misdiagnosis where the clinician ignored my concerns have had a damaging impact on my confidence in the healthcare system and made me rather reluctant to engage with it I try not to be cynical but it feels hard to advocate for yourself as a patient and it s also been very difficult to access treatment aside from Right to Choose not in terms of referrals because I ve not experienced any issues there at all my past GP was great with this I haven t yet needed any at The Chelsea Practice but in terms of waiting lists it feels a little pointless to try,,The-Chelsea-Practice,Brompton-Health-PCN,positive,0.3565507233142853,neutral,0.0,565.0,0,4.0,Waiting Time,,,

2024-03-02 16:25:00,Likely,I joined the Redcliffe Surgery in 1965 That is nearly 60 years ago The current ethos has lost the human ethos of yesteryear partly for reasons that cannot be overcome in the present situation of massive underfunding of the NHS the stupidity of Brexit ever more pressure from ever more patients and much else I know it is harder and harder BUT if you want to improve there is room for improvement 1 My wife is almost 102 years of age I think anyone 80 yrs and more the genuine elderlies need much more careful watching and monitoring especially in regards to the need for follow up Things that a specialist might ask the surgery to do are not done as if the message never got through The follow up in the surgery needs improving more generally 2 It is often necessary to follow up with one s GP and getting through to them can feel like too many hoops to jump If I have a blood test and get a very technical feedback I won t understand it The GP out to explain a complicated list of outcomes automatically 3 I have been seen over months by the Tissue Viability department at St Charles When no longer seen by them they claimed a letter to my surgery detailing my after care was sent But when I raised this with my GP there was general non compression about what TV expected the surgery to do I was left hanging in the air and when an emergency arose neither GP nor supposedly specialist nurse knew what to do 4 Mostly those answering the phone do a good job especially the person who has been there the longest though occasionally messages get confused or are somehow lost in translation so to speak 5 Empathy can be taught The human element aids healing I once was with a GP who as I tried to explain some anxiety regarding my health was looking at their watch Givimng the impression as sub text please go as fast as you can is not good It is anti healing the most basic and worst mistake 6 I think patients such as myself should be invited in to give feedback and make constructive criticism on a regular basis Maybe a group of such people should meet occasionally with doctors cante wasteya Dr PERSON 19sept1945 poorwolf com 0207 [*PHONE*] PS= Some elderly patients will not have computers and will not be able to contact you online Some will not have the computer skills that my grand daughter had at 7 years of age,,Health-Partners-at-Violet-Melchett,Brompton-Health-PCN,negative,0.6275842785835266,neutral,0.0,430.0,0,4.0,Follow-up and Continuity of Care,,,
