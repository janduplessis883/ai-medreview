2024-02-16 11:02:00,Neither good nor poor,I have not had a recent appointmen but I thought I would answer anyway My experience is that when I need a doctor I find it hard to get an appointment unless urgent I need to have a telephone consultation first I was once told I think it was for a persistent and annoying cough that I had had for months after a laryngitis and I wanted to know if there was a cough medicine I could take I was told I should go to A and E but it was not THAT urgent I just needed advice I was quite disappointed and then went to a private GP She saw me the day afterwards scheduled a chest Xray and got me a prescription Also some friends of my age we are all oldies get check ups by their GP but so far I have had to ask for blood tests sometimes asked for by my cardiologist sometimes because I felt a long time had gone by I am aware that COVID has been very detrimental for everybody patients and doctors from many points of view and my problems are minor compared to others However as a result I am stuck seeing a private dermatologist My check ups for a suspicious mole on my back I live alone and have no way to check this myself were continuously cancelled or postponed but I needed it to be seen on consultant s advice in three months Admittedly this was not the GP it was the hospital Now I would be happy to see the GP for regular check ups rather than going to the private consultations So it would be useful to have a regular check up that is my point I have been seen by different doctors not often and they were very nice and one in particular was helpful getting me quick appointments for my thyroid problem I have been impressed with the notices I receive for vaccinations and general information like recently when I was given a possibility to be checked for atrial fibrillation I would have come but was out of the country The staff at the reception is always helpful and kind,I think maybe that the distinction in urgent and non urgent can be off putting when one just maybe needs reassurance or advice and does want to wait two weeks to talk to a doctor What is considered urgent It is really all relative and especially when one is older and lives alone Maybe I was unlucky but now I hesitate calling Thank you for giving me the opportunity to express my experience I know I need to be thankful that I have access to care at all,Stanhope-Mews-Surgery,Brompton-Health-PCN,negative,0.5672797561,neutral,0.598788619,365.0,88,3.0,Appointment Availability,Patient Respect,,,disappointment,gratitude,,,,,,

2024-02-16 11:38:00,Neither good nor poor,I spent less than 10 minutes with the Doctor I had 3 easy questions and on the 3rd question the Doctor says to me this will have to be your last question I had not taken much of her time and yet she seemed annoyed by the amount of enquiry i put forth She mentioned that her prior patients had asked too many questions Later i thought no wonder people are asking so many questions it s so difficult to get an appointment to see a doctor i wasn t there is a limit to how many questions a patient is permitted to ask Maybe she was just having a bad day In which case i understand because it happens,The NHS and Doctors are under tremendous strain so i appreciate the fact that i was able to receive help I guess i just wanted to feel like the Doctor realised how much we patients appreciate them Instead i got the impression i had somehow annoyed her Again though we all have bad days so it s ok,Stanhope-Mews-Surgery,Brompton-Health-PCN,negative,0.5102756023,neutral,0.3730044663,121.0,57,3.0,Appointment Availability,Patient Respect,,,neutral,realization,,,,,,

2024-02-16 14:23:00,Very poor,The surgery clearly has too many patients Getting any appointment has been so difficult that I have had to go private Despite the fact that I m one of the highest tax payers in this country I have limited access to my GP I think it s absolutely appalling that patients have to wait over a week sometimes to get an appointment and then that appointment is solely over the telephone You can t diagnose chest infections over the phone Plus my mother has really been suffering for over a year with pain in her legs hips and groin and was not seem at all Instead she was sent off to some physio to get some exercise pointers She was only given one session and no one has bothered to follow up despite saying they would Plus the surgery focuses its attention on all the wrong things simply to fulfil government mandates rather than actually take care of patient needs I miss the old surgery when there was a walk in for more urgent enquiries and there was better client care Frankly this surgery should not be taking on any more patients because it is incapable of taking care of the patients it does have,,Earls-Court-Surgery,Brompton-Health-PCN,negative,0.8871939778,neutral,0.0,201.0,2,1.0,Appointment Availability,,,,disappointment,,,,,,,

2024-02-29 04:00:00,Don't know,The front desk staff are dedicated and so good at their job I can t speak more highly about the service they provide and some of the doctors including Doctor PERSON who is currently with the practice have been admirable However there is no consistency and no follow through After being referred to a specialist department for further investigation the box is ticked and the patient is cast adrift and left to sink or swim because unless they make a fuss and pester the practice after the referral they are not contacted again Half the problem is that the doctors are never in the practice for any length of time Just as the patient gets to know a doctor and more Importantly the doctor gets to know the patient and take an interest in them the doctor is moved on and the patient has lost the invaluable link with someone who is familiar with their medical history it is just a conveyor belt of people on the move and the insight and help a doctor can provide through personal knowledge of the patient is lost The thing is not all practices are like this Friends in Forest Gate with a tremendous diversity of patients from all over the world where a team of interpreters is on standby tell me the NHS treatment they receive from their local GP Practice is outstanding and very personal with patients being rung by doctors to see how they are doing and same day appointments are nearly always available,No the telephone appointment with Dr PERSON was constructive and helpful for me,Health-Partners-at-Violet-Melchett,Brompton-Health-PCN,positive,0.7161306143,positive,0.8629639149,254.0,13,,Follow-up and Continuity of Care,Appointment Availability,,,neutral,approval,['Wright'],['Wright'],,,,

2024-03-01 19:17:00,Very good,I m very happy with the surgery s GPs the receptionists and admin staff I use the PATCHS system and get a speedy response PATCHS is an easy digital system The digital communication between my Sjogren s Syndrome consultant at Charing Cross and the doctors at my surgery is excellent When my consultant recently sent a letter with a suggestion to the GPs a GP contacted me the next day via PATCHS with this suggestion for further treatment if I wanted it The PATCHS system is used very well by me and the surgery s admin team to very quickly provide me with repeat prescriptions send messages to a GP or the admin team make an appointment etc But of course there are so many patients and so few doctors to cover such a large practice that getting a speedy face to face appointment is impossible unless the info a patient enters into PATCHS suggests that the symptoms indicate an emergency situation But fortunately and knock on wood at 80 soon to be 81 I very rarely have any need to request an appointment So I don t know if the waiting times for an appointment have improved since I had my last appointment for any illness well over a year ago I did notice that the surgery is now open later in the evening which is a good thing and much needed,,Health-Partners-at-Violet-Melchett,Brompton-Health-PCN,positive,0.9633696675,neutral,0.0,226.0,0,5.0,Reception Staff Interaction,,,,approval,,,,,,,

2024-03-02 16:25:00,Good,I joined the Redcliffe Surgery in 1965 That is nearly 60 years ago The current ethos has lost the human ethos of yesteryear partly for reasons that cannot be overcome in the present situation of massive underfunding of the NHS the stupidity of Brexit ever more pressure from ever more patients and much else I know it is harder and harder BUT if you want to improve there is room for improvement 1 My wife is almost 102 years of age I think anyone 80 yrs and more the genuine elderlies need much more careful watching and monitoring especially in regards to the need for follow up Things that a specialist might ask the surgery to do are not done as if the message never got through The follow up in the surgery needs improving more generally 2 It is often necessary to follow up with one s GP and getting through to them can feel like too many hoops to jump If I have a blood test and get a very technical feedback I won t understand it The GP out to explain a complicated list of outcomes automatically 3 I have been seen over months by the Tissue Viability department at St Charles When no longer seen by them they claimed a letter to my surgery detailing my after care was sent But when I raised this with my GP there was general non compression about what TV expected the surgery to do I was left hanging in the air and when an emergency arose neither GP nor supposedly specialist nurse knew what to do 4 Mostly those answering the phone do a good job especially the person who has been there the longest though occasionally messages get confused or are somehow lost in translation so to speak 5 Empathy can be taught The human element aids healing I once was with a GP who as I tried to explain some anxiety regarding my health was looking at their watch Givimng the impression as sub text please go as fast as you can is not good It is anti healing the most basic and worst mistake 6 I think patients such as myself should be invited in to give feedback and make constructive criticism on a regular basis Maybe a group of such people should meet occasionally with doctors cante wasteya Dr PERSON 19sept1945 poorwolf com 0207 [*PHONE*] PS= Some elderly patients will not have computers and will not be able to contact you online Some will not have the computer skills that my grand daughter had at 7 years of age,,Health-Partners-at-Violet-Melchett,Brompton-Health-PCN,negative,0.6275842786,neutral,0.0,430.0,0,4.0,Follow-up and Continuity of Care,,,,neutral,,['Jamie Moran'],,,,,

2024-03-05 09:51:00,Neither good nor poor,This practice used to be excellent but has deteriorated since 2020 The Practice Manager is Very good and rang me immediately after I complained to a doctor Main issues are 1 Inefficient reception staff Any time I phone there can be at least a 10 minute wait for an answer There were 4 at a recent visit but only one was dealing with patients the others were staring at screens Later there were SIX staff all looking confused On my last visit I heard a patient being told by the little Asian female receptionist that Chelsea Westminster Hospital was on Kings Rd I had to tell him the correct location 2 A plastic screen stands between staff and patients meaning neither side can hear properly without shouting often private details The screen has been dirty though it had been cleaned when I went yesterday maybe due to my comment to the Practice Manager It should be removed just causes frustration 3 There s not a feeling of respect by many staff just that you re an inconvenience 4 It s very hard to see a doctor face to face Phone appointments are inconvenient as there is no set time given in the day so very hard particularly if you re working,,Knightsbridge-Medical-Centre,Brompton-Health-PCN,negative,0.86886704,neutral,0.0,207.0,0,3.0,Reception Staff Interaction,,,,annoyance,,,,,,,

2024-04-04 18:41:00,Good,I am writing to express my disappointment and frustration with the appointment availability at your GP surgery As a patient I have been experiencing difficulty in securing an appointment with my regular doctor for several weeks now Despite trying multiple times throughout the week and even making appointments well in advance I have consistently been met with either long wait times or being told that there are no available slots I understand that delays can happen but the frequency of these issues is unacceptable It is frustrating to have to take time off work or away from other responsibilities just to see my doctor only to be left waiting for an extended period of time This is particularly problematic when I am in need of urgent medical attention or have concerns that require prompt attention I have tried contacting the surgery to inquire about availability and was told that there are no appointments available for several weeks This lack of transparency and communication makes it difficult for me to plan my schedule and receive the medical care I need in a timely manner,I urge you to address this issue as a matter of priority Improving appointment availability and communication with patients would greatly enhance the patient experience at your surgery I hope that steps will be taken to rectify this situation and ensure that patients are able to see their doctors in a timely and efficient manner,Earls-Court-Surgery,Brompton-Health-PCN,negative,0.8870767951,positive,0.6315585971,183.0,55,4.0,Appointment Availability,Appointment Availability,,,disappointment,optimism,,,,,,

2024-05-20 15:28:00,Poor,I saw the practice nurse on 2 May 2024 regarding a very sensitive matter She confirmed she would call me to follow up on 8 May 2024 at 12 noon after she had liaised with the GP I made arrangements to be available to speak with her at that time however when she didn t call I rang the surgery only to be told by the Receptionist that the nurse had not spoken with the GP yet It is now 20 May 2024 and I still haven t heard from the nurse No follow up or courtesy call to update me I appreciate that she has a full caseload and may not have been able to get a response from the GP yet however I would expect her to keep in touch Perhaps the nurse doesn t consider it necessary but given thr sensitive nature of my conversation with her I would have thought it would be appropriate for her to get in touch as an indication of how difficult I found discussing the issue with her It makes me disinclined to engage with the nurse going forward as I consider manners and an understanding approach to be paramount in patient practice communications I will arrange to speak to the GP directly to discuss the next steps Please relay this feedback to the practice manager who is welcome to call me,,Health-Partners-at-Violet-Melchett,Brompton-Health-PCN,neutral,0.8416529894,neutral,0.0,227.0,3,2.0,Follow-up and Continuity of Care,,X8vYRe,RRLZdp,neutral,,,,,,,

2024-06-15 23:02:59,Neither good nor poor,I feel misunderstood and uncared for by my main Dr After having spoken to her felt very sad distressed anxious and upset She is nervous and impatient with me despite she is aware of my vulnerabilities and mental health problems she triggers them even more I wait for months and weeks to talk to her two mins over the phone and all she does is hang up the phone on me not even giving me a chance to let me say what I have to say and English is not my first language and I have EUPD and other emotional dis regulations and traumatic stress related mental struggles She is always antagonising fighting me expect me to do all by myself even the referrals which need to be done by a Dr Even I spoke to South Kensington Chelsea CMHT Hounslow East MINT which told me my Dr should be helping me to get what I need and that I should not be chasing them myself The reality is that I need a Dr referral and the referral has to be done properly and chased up She is not even taking sufficient time and patience to understand and come towards my needs Everybody I talk to rely so much on their Drs and tell me stories how their Drs turned things around for them I do know that my Dr wrote only things that were unhelpful to make things worse for me to so that my charges would not get dropped she wrote I have no problems because my conditions are not causing me any problems and she is no psychiatrist no cardiologist and no diabetic consultant to state any of that And after all wonder if you can help someone a good person why would you not It is absolutely reprovable Even when she does a referral she is doing the least she can to properly allow a communication to understand what is going on what support I need and why I was trying to tell her the council is not providing me the help because it has to come from mental health and the nurse from mental health which was at the care act assessment said I have no mental problems which is not true so now they said it is my Dr that should have a say My Dr is telling me I can self refer that is not true she is lying I cannot self refer to see a consultant to have a clinician coordinator social worker you cannot I referred myself to a social worker but they said it has to come from CMHT which I cannot self refer I am not sure if I am being played around but this is what they said at RBKC council social services I think the council social services and my Dr both should ensure I get the support I need from mental health She is not helping me to get any NHS psychological therapies she refuses me a social prescriber which I need she is not referring me to a mental health clinician social worker She is not even referring me to see a consultant and she is not taking time to comprehend how much and what I am struggling with Since I am with this Dr she has done nothing for me because the referral needs to be done properly extensively explained then chased up With my previous Dr I always had therapies even when out of community he would get me to go at Community Living Well not letting me self refer so they reject me he would do the referral for me always and so he had referred ne to have a social worker which I did have for two years in the past from RBKC he would always do referrals for me always And whilst in temporary accomodation in supported home ge got me under CMHT for psychotherapy for one years This Dr has done nothing for me I am a good woman which should be helped She thinks I am getting the right therapies at the women s centre and with the Samaritans She must be joking I am feeling very very unwell mentally suffering past trauma and so much stress day after day because of the abuse I suffered at the hands of the police over the years and she has not even written an helping letter to my legal no Dr would ever do that She wrote everything is fine I have no issue if you can help a patient to overcome the deepest social injustices why would you not Even the referral for cardiology I explained to her patients are able to choose what hospital to attend and I attended Cardiology at Brompton Chelsea Westminstee and Charing Cross before even St Charles Community Hospital told me it is not true the Dr cannot refer me to my hospital of choice or an hospital which is closer to me I lost my appointments because they were given to me with little no notice on days I could not go and was not even able to tell her this because the hang up the phone on me whilst I was talking to her,Certainly it would have helped me to be with a different Dr like Dr PERSON but Dr PERSON control everything over my medical matters so the other Drs at the practice cannot do anything in terms of pursuing any of my referrals It would also help to have a choice on what hospital to attend or what course of treatment and support is best for me like I used to Not just assume the Samaritans or St Charles Community Hospital suffice my needs whether they are mental or physical Also would help meeting face to face having not so rushed appointments being calm and patient having a chance and enough time to speak and having some support with me whilst I speak like a social prescriber a support or social worker or a mental health advocate,Emperors-Gate-Health-Centre,Brompton-Health-PCN,negative,0.9248549342,neutral,0.6842193604,878.0,136,3.0,Feedback and

2024-06-25 06:50:56,Don't know,My GP said would have followed up the transfer of care from Hounslow East Mint as well do a new referral to South West London CMHT however as I spoke to SPA today they told me no referral has ever been received from my GP I need to be under a CPA Care Programm Approach Programm with a keyworker and a care coordinator This is specific for people with mental health problems personality disorders complex needs etc as well homeless in temporary accomodation I am meant to get this since 2020 my keyworker in supported home was following up on this but then I was evicted from the said home as I suffered criminal charges whilst living there The GP must do an URGENT referral for me to be under a Care Programme Approach or equivalent level of care and coordination so that I can discuss my needs with my local CMHT teams receive the right level of care and support and move on accordingly SW CMHT have to stop saying when I have a permanent hone I will be supported by them as that is also what the CPA or equivalent level of care is there for to also help people move on To be honest I should have got it back in 2017 when I initially became homeless At the moment I am being treated as if I have no needs no support in place and no move on points so that I can get appropriate place to suit my mental and physical needs After 6 years of homelessness I should not be forced to be moved into an unsuitable permanent accomodation to then start all over again a move on scheme especially as permanent homes needs repairs work and furnishing I cannot cope with that twice after all I have already been put through nobody should Also I was to get this level of care in Hounslow as I had a move on clinician and a liason nurse there however their transfer of care also does not appear to have been received and needs to be chased up by my GP I need to understand why my referral to be under a CPA was not made by my GP and if made what was the outcome in writing as we will need to complain to the Ombusdman health if rejected,The referral being urgently made as promised because now since Hounslow discharged me my care plan has been unfairly interrupted Also receive more regular at least weekly follow ups from my GP on the progress of my care referral or at least from the practice receptionists or manager in charge I need to be kept up to date regularly on what is going on with my care referrals,Emperors-Gate-Health-Centre,Brompton-Health-PCN,neutral,0.7730178237,neutral,0.5185340047,393.0,68,,Follow-up and Continuity of Care,Follow-up and Continuity of Care,GbdVo2,8PNorA,neutral,neutral,,,,,,

2024-08-21 17:33:00,Poor,I am only giving this feedback because I was invited to do so and so I must speak the truth as I see it From a recent visitation to the clinic it gives me enough motivation to say this I believe the clinic has a responsibility to attend to the needs of their patients rather than to pre assume their needs I also believe that the role of a clinic is not just to tend to the sick but to also tend to the healthy so that the healthy remain healthy and the sick are cured and made healthy This makes the clinic a clinic for all people and a cornerstone for people√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s lives to show that a clinic cares for the patient regardless of how sick they are This build a strong foundation for a trusting and healthy society That is why I believe it is important for the clinic to allow general health examinations for healthy or sick patients where the goal is for the doctor to assess analyse and highlight any health problems concerns or issues that come up in tests or examinations of the patient√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s body which can include but not limited to tests that record the health of their organs general fitness assessment of fat storages sugar levels or any general precursor known through modern research to future illness There is a saying that goes that prevention is better than cure and we should strive to build a preventative clinic as well as a clinic that cures I trust the expertise of the doctors to find suitable tests for us instead of us needing to play the role of the doctor and ask the doctors for tests we are not educated about Please also recognise that in this scenario the patient may not be aware of any medical issues or conditions because it is the role of the doctor to tell the patient if there are health concerns or risks that they should look out for this could be diet fitness or even assessments of general muscular and spinal health I was appalled at the lack of knowledge surrounding preventative assessments we as patients do not wish to come to you when we are sick we would rather come to you healthy and have the doctor affirm and verify that there are no health concerns and we do not have to come back often I believe the management should be capable of figuring out time periods for patients so that a general health check up doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t happen all the time The doctors also should know what I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m talking about I simply cannot believe that they are ignorant of what a general health and body examination is I believe that staff should learn to love one another as well as their patients to treat them with dignity and respect and unfortunately one doctor is ruining the reputation for all of you but I do not wish to give out names The staff should communicate with each other and show love and respect for one another and not to dismiss and ignore for we all share this broken world and we do not know when our time is up The staff should show love and respect to patients because they have placed their trust in you I do not believe it is helpful to portray patients in a negative light or to be judgemental of their background or assuming of where they come from We all want to build a positive and happy work environment that patients can see and staff can enjoy Management should be equipped with methods to do that I pray that future patients will not receive what I experienced because it can be very hurtful for those who are anxious about their health and I had anxiety attacks and heart palpitations for 4 hours after the consultation I do not wish to dig further into the session and pulling out examples and evidence to prove my point and pedantic about terminologies and truth conditions as I experienced in the clinic breaks trust and does not build rapport with patients because I see it as a form of interrogation and is unbecoming of a health clinic that is supposed to form positive and happy relationships with patients Putting patients on the spot to recall facts about their medical history to try and trip them in the session where the facts have already been disclosed shows a lack of trust and communication from staff and a hostile tone I hope that staff will be happy and motivated to be thoughtful advisory and honest about the medical status of patients showing patient care and their history with other doctors so they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to assess patients fresh and I pray that light will shine on Scarsdale to improve and that staff are happy and are friends with each other in their workplace It is hurtful for me to see staff that are unhappy because it makes me unhappy and it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t improve my mental health when I see doctors and staff who I look up to and respect who themselves seem to need medical attention I hope you will take this advice constructively and I do not wish to be confrontational at all God bless you and may better days

2024-12-02 14:38:00,Good,The doctor I spoke to was extremely clear and understanding and offered me advice and a path forward which was much appreciated,After having a Dexa scan at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital I rang Health Partners 3 times regarding my results each time I was advised that the hospital had not sent the results through After each call I followed up with the hospital the 1st time 2 weeks after the scan I was advised they were short staffed but they would be sending the results out the following week I waited for 2 weeks called Health Partners and was told nothing had been received 2nd call to the hospital I was advised that the results had been sent to Health Partners the week before with 7 other patients results I called Health Partners again who advised that they had received an email but it had gone up someone who wasn t there and no one else could access the information but that if I hadn t received a letter the hospital had clearly not sent the results through I called the hospital for a 3rd time and spoke to the PA of the Consultant in charge who advised that Health Partners had had the results for several weeks along with the results for 7 other patients This PA then said she would call the Health Partners surgery herself as she was concerned that results had gone astray I called the surgery then and asked for a telephone appointment Still at this point I wasn t sure if my results had been properly received but that this might be a good way to move things forward It was as the disc to I spoke to had everything to hand Perhaps it would be good for more than one person to have access to hospital results just to save on unnecessary calling,Health-Partners-at-Violet-Melchett,Brompton-Health-PCN,positive,0.9614381194114684,neutral,0.6302586197853088,22.0,286,4.0,Patient Respect,Accessibility and Convenience,YlVd5z,4zGaqd,admiration,neutral,,,nhs_app24,Yes,4.0,
