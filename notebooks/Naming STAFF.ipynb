The reception staff's attitude has changed considerably and from a patient point of view not for the better.  There is no empathy and a reluctance to be constructively helpful, which verges on rudeness.\\nI have experienced finally getting through on the phone after waiting a long time, only to be told I am past the cutoff so have to call back at 2.00.   There ought to be a number reserved for people like me who care for an elderly person with dementia and who doesn't know how the day will pan out - I can't always be hanging on the phone at 8.30 in the morning or 2.00 pm.   My husband is 91, has vascular dementia and mobility problems.  \\n\\nRecently I witnessed one of your receptionists remark to a patient,  who arrived clearly in distress and  trying to see a doctor for an emergency appointment at 11.15, that she was too late and anyway would need to speak to a doctor on the phone before she could get a face to face.  The distressed lady who was having trouble with her breathing said that A&E had told her to come to her surgery if she experienced breathing trouble again. The receptionist offered no empathy or support - remember that A&E had instructed this lady to go to her GP.  All your receptionist could repeat to her was she would have to call on the phone at 2.00 for an appointment for an initial telephone triage with a doctor.  \\nThe receptionist then stated that a drop in surgery would be chaos, clearly she hadn't been in the job very long because one of the main reasons we transferred to Stanhope Mews West surgery from Redcliffe was precisely because there was a daily drop in surgery and it was never chaos.\\n\\nSee below my most recent incident at your surgery, as an illustration of the calibre and attitude of your reception staff.\\n\\nAt the beginning of January, I brought in a urine sample for my husband, having been instructed to do so on Christmas Eve by the out of hours doctor.  My husband actually spent Christmas day and Boxing day in the Chelsea & Westminster with Covid as well as a UTI.  On discharge the Chelsea & Westminster doctor also confirmed I should bring a sample to the surgery for follow up testing.  I brought in the sample and the lady at reception told me that she couldn't help because I had no form and no doctor from the practice had requested the sample.  After much pleading she reluctantly agreed to contact a practice doctor for a form.  Why she couldn't consult my husband's records to see what had happened to him over Christmas, I do not know.   After nearly half an hour, another lady from reception asked her how she had contacted the doctor about my husband's sample.  By email, came the reply.  The other lady then told her to message a doctor and came out to see me.  She apologised for the unhelpful attitude and said it shouldn't have happened.  I nearly wrote to complain then but my life is complicated looking after my husband, so I didn't.  This survey has given me the opportunity to air my grievances.\\n\\n The reception staff need to be more helpful \",\n",

My experience is that when I need a doctor, I find it hard to get an appointment unless urgent,  I need to have a telephone consultation first.\\n I was once told, I think it was for a persistent and annoying cough that I had had for months after a laryngitis and I wanted to know if there was a cough medicine I could take. .I was told I should go to A and E but it was not THAT urgent, I just needed advice. I was quite disappointed and then went to a private GP. She saw me the day afterwards, scheduled a chest Xray and got me a prescription.  \\nAlso, some friends of my age, (we are all oldies) get check ups by their GP but so far I have had to ask for blood tests, sometimes asked for by my cardiologist, sometimes because I felt a long time had gone by.\\n  \\nI am aware that COVID has been very detrimental for everybody, patients and doctors from many points of view and my \"problems\" are minor compared to others. However, as a result   I am stuck seeing a private dermatologist. My check ups for a suspicious mole (on my back, I live alone and have no way to check this myself) were continuously cancelled or postponed but I needed it to be seen, on consultant\\'s advice \"in three months\". Admittedly, this was not the GP, it was the hospital. Now I would be happy to see the GP for regular check ups rather than going to the private consultations.\\n\\nSo, it would be useful to have a regular check up, that is my point.\\n\\nI have been seen by different doctors, not often and they were very nice and one in particular was helpful getting me quick appointments for my thyroid \"problem\". \\nI have been impressed with the notices I receive for vaccinations and general information, like recently, when I was given a possibility to be checked for atrial fibrillation. I would have come but was out of the country!\\nThe staff at the reception is always helpful and kind. \\n \\n I think maybe, that the distinction in \"urgent\" and \"non urgent\"  can be off putting when one just maybe needs reassurance or advice and does want to wait two weeks to talk to a doctor. What is considered urgent? It is really all relative and especially when one is older and lives alone.  Maybe I was unlucky  but now I hesitate calling. \\nThank you for giving me the opportunity to express my experience. I know I need to be thankful that I have access to care at all!',\n",

She mentioned that her prior patients had asked too many questions. Later i thought, no wonder people are asking so many questions - it’s so difficult to get an appointment to see a doctor. -  i wasn’t there is a limit to how many questions a patient is permitted  to ask. Maybe she was just having a bad day? In which case i understand because , it happens.  The NHS and Doctors are under tremendous strain so i appreciate the fact that i was able to receive help.

You can’t diagnose chest infections over the phone. Plus my mother has really been suffering for over a year with pain in her legs, hips and groin and was not seem at all. Instead she was sent off to some physio to get some exercise pointers. She was only given one session and no one has bothered to follow up despite saying they would. Plus the surgery focuses its attention on all the wrong things simply to fulfil government mandates rather than actually take care of patient needs. I miss the old surgery when there was a walk-in for more urgent enquiries, and there was better client care.

Fortunately I wasn’t presenting in a stressed mind frame, but this is a communication failure similar to what I remembered from the previous premises in SW10, so not promising.
