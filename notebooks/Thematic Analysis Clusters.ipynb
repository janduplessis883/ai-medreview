      " 'The surgery clearly has too many patients Getting any appointment has been so difficult that I have had to go private Despite the fact that I m one of the highest tax payers in this country I have limited access to my GP I think it s absolutely appalling that patients have to wait over a week sometimes to get an appointment and then that appointment is solely over the telephone You can t diagnose chest infections over the phone Plus my mother has really been suffering for over a year with pain in her legs hips and groin and was not seem at all Instead she was sent off to some physio to get some exercise pointers She was only given one session and no one has bothered to follow up despite saying they would Plus the surgery focuses its attention on all the wrong things simply to fulfil government mandates rather than actually take care of patient needs I miss the old surgery when there was a walk in for more urgent enquiries and there was better client care Frankly this surgery should not be taking on any more patients because it is incapable of taking care of the patients it does have'\n",

      " 'As a newcomer to your surgery March 2023 I went in person to register etc Unwelcoming receptionist dealt with me and was fairly unhelpful Since then emails have been lost appointments made for an address in Chelsea Manor Street turned out to be in the main surgery and to date I still have no idea who your Doctor s are or how many I had spoken on the phone to a Doctor but he apparently left when I tried to make contact with him It may be that you have too many patients and not enough time deal with them For my point of view a very different experience from my previous surgery in Oxfordshire'\n",
      " 'I haven t used the surgery much only did so for the Covid vaccines but when I went to do the tests I was asked to do the care at the practice was good Only disappointment was when I asked to get a second opinion to those of my private GP regarding my ailments I was informed that could only take place if I had all my records transferred to the practice I couldn t have both Having been with my private GP for 36 years that would have been quite an ordeal I believe it is wise sometimes to get a second opinion if an ailment can t be sorted'\n",

      " 'I think the move to PERSON t has been very successful but of course this is partly because we only live about 300 yards away I find the messaging system difficult to use although to be fair I ve only used it once I simply drop a note into the surgery and I do get a very speedy response by text So a big thanks My experience of the surgery and the NHS in general is very positive'\n",

      " 'I m very happy with the surgery s GPs the receptionists and admin staff I use the PATCHS system and get a speedy response PATCHS is an easy digital system The digital communication between my Sjogren s Syndrome consultant at Charing Cross and the doctors at my surgery is excellent When my consultant recently sent a letter with a suggestion to the GPs a GP contacted me the next day via PATCHS with this suggestion for further treatment if I wanted it The PATCHS system is used very well by me and the surgery s admin team to very quickly provide me with repeat prescriptions send messages to a GP or the admin team make an appointment etc But of course there are so many patients and so few doctors to cover such a large practice that getting a speedy face to face appointment is impossible unless the info a patient enters into PATCHS suggests that the symptoms indicate an emergency situation But fortunately and knock on wood at 80 soon to be 81 I very rarely have any need to request an appointment So I don t know if the waiting times for an appointment have improved since I had my last appointment for any illness well over a year ago I did notice that the surgery is now open later in the evening which is a good thing and much needed'\n",

      " 'I am only giving this feedback because I was invited to do so and so I must speak the truth as I see it From a recent visitation to the clinic it gives me enough motivation to say this I believe the clinic has a responsibility to attend to the needs of their patients rather than to pre assume their needs I also believe that the role of a clinic is not just to tend to the sick but to also tend to the healthy so that the healthy remain healthy and the sick are cured and made healthy This makes the clinic a clinic for all people and a cornerstone for peopleâ€™s lives to show that a clinic cares for the patient regardless of how sick they are This build a strong foundation for a trusting and healthy society That is why I believe it is important for the clinic to allow general health examinations for healthy or sick patients where the goal is for the doctor to assess analyse and highlight any health problems concerns or issues that come up in tests or examinations of the patientâ€™s body which can include but not limited to tests that record the health of their organs general fitness assessment of fat storages sugar levels or any general precursor known through modern research to future illness There is a saying that goes that prevention is better than cure and we should strive to build a preventative clinic as well as a clinic that cures I trust the expertise of the doctors to find suitable tests for us instead of us needing to play the role of the doctor and ask the doctors for tests we are not educated about Please also recognise that in this scenario the patient may not be aware of any medical issues or conditions because it is the role of the doctor to tell the patient if there are health concerns or risks that they should look out for this could be diet fitness or even assessments of general muscular and spinal health I was appalled at the lack of knowledge surrounding preventative assessments we as patients do not wish to come to you when we are sick we would rather come to you healthy and have the doctor affirm and verify that there are no health concerns and we do not have to come back often I believe the management should be capable of figuring out time periods for patients so that a general health check up doesnâ€™t happen all the time The doctors also should know what Iâ€™m talking about I simply cannot believe that they are ignorant of what a general health and body examination is I believe that staff should learn to love one another as well as their patients to treat them with dignity and respect and unfortunately one doctor is ruining the reputation for all of you but I do not wish to give out names The staff should communicate with each other and show love and respect for one another and not to dismiss and ignore for we all share this broken world and we do not know when our time is up The staff should show love and respect to patients because they have placed their trust in you I do not believe it is helpful to portray patients in a negative light or to be judgemental of their background or assuming of where they come from We all want to build a positive and happy work environment that patients can see and staff can enjoy Management should be equipped with methods to do that I pray that future patients will not receive what I experienced because it can be very hurtful for those who are anxious about their health and I had anxiety attacks and heart palpitations for 4 hours after the consultation I do not wish to dig further into the session and pulling out examples and evidence to prove my point and pedantic about terminologies and truth conditions as I experienced in the clinic breaks trust and does not build rapport with patients because I see it as a form of interrogation and is unbecoming of a health clinic that is supposed to form positive and happy relationships with patients Putting patients on the spot to recall facts about their medical history to try and trip them in the session where the facts have already been disclosed shows a lack of trust and communication from staff and a hostile tone I hope that staff will be happy and motivated to be thoughtful advisory and honest about the medical status of patients showing patient care and their history with other doctors so they donâ€™t have to assess patients fresh and I pray that light will shine on Scarsdale to improve and that staff are happy and are friends with each other in their workplace It is hurtful for me to see staff that are unhappy because it makes me unhappy and it doesnâ€™t improve my mental health when I see doctors and staff who I look up to and respect who themselves seem to need medical attention I hope you will take this advice constructively and I do not wish to be confrontational at all God bless you and may better days come'\n",
