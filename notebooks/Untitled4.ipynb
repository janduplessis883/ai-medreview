      "3.28 - I wish there are follow ups by GP especially when tests are taken It is my understanding that a recently launched NHS App is expected to provide this function however the App is not working i e it only gives error messages every time I try to use any functions The waiting area of the practice is quite worn down which was noticed even by my kids None of my recent visits were on time even though I always come at least 5 minutes before my appointments GPs also seems to have limited tools available for them to perform basic tests they were able to perform in the past i e for example urine test analysis or swap tests etc It seems to be generally a very high rotation of GPs at the practice to the extend that regular patients have to retell their medical history i e no continuation or possibility to see the same doctor It used to be the same doctor for the entire family now there is no complete picture for any of the doctors to connect the dots if several members of the family have the same health issues\n",
      "3.24 - I m happy with the GPs and overall standards of care Recent experiences of arranging appointments have improved but generally the administration is still appalling There are multiple access channels some of which are no reply forcing me back to the phone I use the NHS app but it feels hit and miss whether I will be able to do things on the app often I get messages to say your practice does not support x Appointment calendars only look 2 weeks ahead and get fully booked up so I get told to ring back in a week that is insane I get sent appointments for things I never asked for eg tests at times I can t make but no means of referring back so the time just gets wasted I get sent appointments for things I do want at times that suit you but not me so even more time is wasted I know you are not stupid people so I have to conclude that you the partners are not really focused on the needs of your patients or if you are then you are unwilling to confront the poor performance of your practice managers\n",
      "3.23 - I was comforted by the fact that I received a telephone call from a doctor checking on me Given the hardships currently faced by the NHS I thought it very impressive I felt valued and significant\n",
      "3.22 - HOWEVER only if under the age of 40 Alas the minute you need to phone or speak to to your Doctor be minded that you can be told that neither is possible the foreseeable future For routine things such as blood tests medicine prescriptions Covid vaccinations it is quite wonderful This app has a lot to do with that\n",
      "3.18 - Nothing it worked fine for me saving me a walk to the surgery and the doctor I spoke with was very helpful thoughtful kind and considerate as well as being professional at all times love our nhs\n",
      "3.18 - This is based on scheduling a referral that has taken 2 months to get a date and now the date is May 2025 This is not about just the GP surgery but the NHS as an organisation\n",
      "3.18 - Because the doctor answered my questions and read me the last report from the NHS colorectal department at C W which I hadn t seen before I liked her very much but can t spell her surname\n",
      "3.18 - Receptionist was unhelpful didn t understand the request for information repeatedly talked over me and was rude and arrogant Given the patient pays handsomely for the NHS service it is a disgraceful way to treat a patient\n",
      "3.15 - My flu jab took only two mins and I liked the nurse I was amazed by the number of texts and app messages you sent trying to persuade me to have the jab It made me wonder if you are very short of patients at the moment but the nurse says you simply have a system of multiple sending of messages\n",
      "3.14 - You keep calling and messaging me about things that we have discussed arranged or sorted out previously That s a waste of time and very annoying Your communications with hospitals NHS trusts outside your own area is awful\n",
      "3.14 - After a couple not so good experiances with nhs recently Dr PERSON and Dr PERSON followed up quickly on a problem I was having I was surprised and grateful how efficient they have been in dealing with me\n",
      "3.09 - Why would I recommend your NHS surgery to people who are not eligible to use your services People living in the area are more than Good to be registered with you already You are NOT some high street shop\n",
      "3.05 - I am a medical doctor myself and I think the practice is performing great with a brilliant staff to the service I would not ask for more Well done One Very good NHS practice to have is a big plus\n",
      "3.05 - I have been a patient of the Chelsea Practice for a number of years They have always been professional kind calling and excellent in all areas of medical practice The NHS should be proud to have such an exceptional team\n",
      "3.00 - Your medical staff at Scarsdale are so caring and helpful Its unfortunate that when a referral is made the medical experience offered by NHS in all London hospitals is quite literally horrendous and a national disgrace Sorry but you did ask\n",
      "3.00 - Dr PERSON is brilliant She of the best GPs I ve ever seen She took time to assess my condition ordered a complete set of tests and was incredibly thoughtful and reassuring and thorough The NHS is lucky to have her\n",
      "2.96 - Although it s sometimes difficult to book a face to face appointment telephone appointment are perfectly acceptable first port of call and very time efficient Great service and great care especially knowing how stretched the NHS resources are Continue the great work\n",
      "2.96 - Stanhope Mews West Surgery is the best surgery I ve ever experienced All doctors my daughter and i have seen so far were very helpful knowledgable and understanding they actually listen to their patients which doesn t always happen on the NHS\n",
      "2.92 - The doctors are Very good as is one of the nurses PERSON Everyone else in particular the reception staff practice manager and PERSON are terrible They are unprofessional and inefficient If it was not an NHS practice they would never keep their jobs\n",
      "2.92 - Reception staff are lovely rare for a g p practice these days Doctors and nurses do listen and are caring and most importantly do see patients It s not just a telephone service which is how most of the nhs operates these days\n",
      "2.88 - You genuinely feel that every GP wants to assist their patient and does not hide behind all the other disputes we are bombarded with in the news and broadsheets concerning the NHS My humble opinion is that this a well run and organised team\n",
      "2.81 - I registered for an emergency call with the GP around 1 30 and mananged to secure a telephone consultation for 3 50 this was immediately followed by survey form to complete with diagnosis which I completed within minutes and set my alarm for 3 50 and dowloaded photos with my symptoms and literally 5 mins later I got a call from dr PERSON mavari who prescribed me with medication Wonderful service and if NHS can appoint Gp s like Dr PERSON mavari all NHS problems will be resolved Dr PERSON mavari and team run and amazing practice Thank you 🙏\n",
      "2.81 - I left the UK in 2020 and have written and called more than a dozen times to ask you to remove me from your records I realise the NHS is under pressure but do you have any idea how infuriating this is Please STOP harassing me\n",
      "2.78 - The appointment booking process is quite clunky but its not difficult to use It would be better if the whole process was delivered in a single app However I was very happy with my overall experience The call centre is very quick to answer the response to booking requests come back very quickly the three doctors I saw dealt with my problems sympathetically and professionally and my prescriptions came through the following day\n",
      "2.77 - Request made by my cardiologist for a prescription was turned down on grounds of not currently offering this drug but watch our website and things might change Clearly a hopeless position driven by local budgets in an environment where the drug is available elsewhere on the NHS\n",
      "2.73 - If you would really like my sadly very low opinion of your surgery and the NHS in general please refer to the ever patient PERSON I m too exhausted and in too much pain and with too little sleep for over 9 months now still without a diagnosis\n",
      "2.73 - Received the invite for free NHS flu jab Made the booking for a convenient speedy appointment Was given good directions from main desk staff to the small clinic extension round the corner Vaccination was carried out on time by an efficient friendly person almost painlessly Clean pleasant rooms\n",
      "2.73 - I arrived at 2 30 for my appointment this was not logged in As a result I have had a message from NHS that I missed my appointment In fact I was there received the RSV jab satisfactorily when PERSON came called out my name So good bad\n",
      "2.68 - I contacted the practice with a concern about discomfort pain nausea in my lower abdomen via the app Within a few minutes I was called back and given an appointment the very same morning My appointment with Dr PERSON was very good thorough friendly and reassuring I was sent off for bloods and earmarked for a US abdomen Once the blood test results had come in I was given a date to discuss them with a doctor the following week As I had problems opening the test results the lovely receptionist assistant PERSON went the extra mile sending the results a different way and giving me clear instructions on how to get access via the app with all sorts of codes and passwords Last Friday I discussed the findings with Dr PERSON over the phone very friendly and informative and I am also scheduled for the US on the 13 12 24 Fantastic service and care So impressed and happy Thank you\n",
      "2.63 - Service all depends on the receptionist you get some more understanding and helpful then others Dr PERSON is great but really really hard to get an apt NHS has to understand that seeing the sane GP that knows you will mean less time wasted and less visits to the GP practice\n",
      "2.57 - I have now had 12 NHS appointments which have resulted in my having to spend lots of money going privately to a podiatrist as none of the people I saw actually sent me to one athough they all agreed I should see one They all managed to send me to wrong people mainly one another The last person sent me a referral letter to a private neuropathic person who I had supplied the name of as neither she nor the previous GP I saw knew one What a waste of NHS money And what gross inefficiency And what a colossal waste of everyone s time including mine And what hopeless and appalling health care\n",
      "2.57 - Just recently required more assistance and have used NHS also for some scan blood test more than usual and sometimes difficult to reach the doctor or to get the results of blood test or scan if sent directly to me I could have a quick turnaround even a copy for my specialist etc\n",
      "2.52 - i spoke to a doctor that was difficult and would not provide me any solutions to my problems non of the NHS medicines work for my HRT so i have had to go private and use an off market drug at huge costs I asked if i could at least do my bloods through the NHS and she took offence that I was using a non NHS drug and refused to let me do the bloods Also i have had scabes since last july I got a letter that they will consider giving me a specialist dermatological visit mid april I also saw a GP and i told her one of my menopause symptoms and she had never heard of it later when i spoke to a specialist they confirmed i was right I find it worrying that I know more than my GP It is also very hard to get an in person visit I either have to wait weeks or go and sit min 5 hours in the hospital emergency room this has been the norm since covid\n",
      "2.48 - The lady I saw for the cholesterol blood cardiovascular check was fortunately able to arrange another test on the spot with a colleague for the atrial fibrillation It wasn t made clear to me in the original texts I got from the NHS that these two tests were separate things requiring separate bookings to be made\n",
      "2.45 - Incompetent team down to the fact that they knew I had to have further blood test so they gave me an Appointment that I went to to set another appointment for a blood test NHS service is by far the worst health system compared to all Europe Please change that system it s as simple as horrible\n",
      "2.42 - The fact that it is almost impossible to see a doctor in person is absurd GP s are the triage for the rest of the NHS services and yet their reluctance to actually see patients and resolve issues before they become acute is astonishing It s a shame and speaks to the care less attitude of the doctors\n",
      "2.41 - Terrible service Can t get through Extremely rude receptionist who was barely literate who took over half an hour to give a simple blood test app refused to book tests on damr day which meant I was unable ti book the other tests Then told me the reason I can t get through is because of people like me This complaint is going to be escalated to the relevant bodies Enough is enough of this terrible surgery Had extreme mental health concerns and they have done nothing to help\n",
      "2.37 - It was great at my appointment the doctor that saw me recommended me to see a skin specialist for some marks on my face and it would be great if I knew the steps on how to do that through the NHS or if a referral was done for me otherwise Iâ€™m waiting for the next meeting and asking again\n",
      "2.37 - I have now wasted 10 NHS appointments being referred to the wrong people This is an appalling waste of money and 6 months later I still havent seen someone who can simply do something about my feet If I ran my psychotherapy practice like this not only would I be out of business but my clients would have suffered abominably\n",
      "2.37 - I requested a referral to a particular NHS surgeon and it was prepared the same day 2 January by the doctor who sent me a text to say this had been done It then took until 14 January to clear the system after much prompting by me including two calls in person at the surgery when I was given misinformation\n",
      "2.37 - My visit with the GP was wonderful she was super helpful Sadly my prior health records which had been supplied are not available within the NHS system Therefore my doctor was unable to access my prior records Additionally there is no way for me to track my pending appointments that are waitlisted are in progress for them to be secured\n",
      "2.37 - My visit with the GP was wonderful she was super helpful Sadly my prior health records which had been supplied are not available within the NHS system Therefore my doctor was unable to access my prior records Additionally there is no way for me to track my pending appointments that are waitlisted are in progress for them to be secured\n",
      "2.32 - Iâ€™m patient in that GP from 2003 l mean 21 years but the system of that GP itâ€™s bad starting ignoring and today l was having an appointment at 10H40 and l was in the GP at 10H30 but l was waiting over 1 hour without seeing the doctor l was getting stressed and frustrated and then left the GP itâ€™s shameful and I canâ€™t support NHS or l give them Good feedback and l donâ€™t care about my GP when Iâ€™m getting sick l go to emergency hospital waiting 1hour with out appointment itâ€™s okay Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m getting sick more about this mentality of NHS staff but never mind my English is not Good enough but Iâ€™m gonna go to citizens advice and making complaints and put the website feedback\n",

      "2.32 - Since I am 80 my friends and family have no need for my advice as they all live and are signed up elsewhere If for any reason they moved to our area I would certainly recommend Stanhope Mews West since it s clear that the NHS around the country is very variable and that we are very lucky to enjoy your services\n",
      "2.32 - You have sent me ton16 appointments with the wrong people This is a gross waste of NHS resources Plus as you dont answer the phone and your email system is unusable I have to travel half an hour to come to ask someone even the simplest thing If I ran my practice like this I wouldn t have a practice any longer\n",
      "2.32 - Given the pressure for appointments and NHS overload it works well But it is a pity that there is no continuity in who once consults nor an allocated GP which my local Holland Park Surgery says it does Dr PERSON who I saw recently and spoke to today has been focussed and understanding it would be good if she had that role\n",
      "2.29 - At 9am I took my wee into the surgery on the 10th February The doctor acted very quickly and within an hour I was at Boots getting my prescription Excellent I then heard on 13th that I needed a different prescription So went and got that but with a few hitches But am better now But all in all the NHS is wonderful\n",
      "2.27 - I expect that I have been given some prescripts medicines for cough and flu ðŸ˜ rather than advice by doctor to take a rest for self recovery I have suffered the coughs with sleepless nights and the virus spread to other family members which I think the dr visits is not useful to me NHS needs to look into this for more efficient practice\n",
      "2.21 - I arrived at 1a Chelsea Manor Place receptionist pleasant although eating at desk I was seen by Mr PERSON on time and rec d flu vax at appointed time I was not offered any patient documentation for this vax but on my asking for details of manf and type I was shown details I entered them on the vax record book NHS gave me some years ago and Mr PERSON signed it I asked for and received a blood pressure test 105 71 I have still not heard back from the HPVMP pharmacist re statins When I had my BP 115 72 taken by Nurse PERSON perhaps a month ago she said she would give the result to the pharmacist and he wd phone No such luck then or now Is the NHS trying to have us use statins or not\n",
      "2.19 - Went for some blood tests for Menopause was told would be contacted when the results were out instead got a link to the NHS site and a link to pre diabetes no call and no follow up with the GP al lthis was done so that i could sit down with the GP and discuss my options for menopause I took the time to go twice to the GP practice and follow the requests ie cant see the GP unless you do this blood test and now i need to chase again to actually see the GP and discuss the results not happy i hardly ever go and see my GP once every 5 years at most and now that i am pre menopausal and want to discuss with GP its not taken seriously and jsut get random emails to the NHS site\n",
      "2.17 - I find the reception staff always helpful and friendly It is sometimes some time before I can see my preferred GP which is something I have come to accept However when I do see her it is well worth the wait as she is always 5 star Under the present circumstances and difficulties with the NHS I feel very lucky grateful to have such a good practice overall\n",
      "2.01 - I have visited Violet Melchett Health Partners twice recently as a new patient and I am incredibly satisfied with the care I have received On both occasions the doctors care was compassionate knowledgeable and efficient More than this both went out of their way to provide further support by email and phone after gaining information on my behalf Considering this is NHS care and the service is stretched I am impressed and feel taken care of\n",
      "2.00 - I had a great experience with Dr PERSON both when I attended an appointment for my daughter and in the appointment she booked for me to see her at The WellWoman Clinic I also found PERSON very good ay a previous appointment BUT booking appointments is a nightmare and if O don t get a knowledgeable person on reception I get told different things Also follow up isn t good My hip x ray arrived after my appmt with PERSON and noone reached out to me about it I discovered it by accident on the NHS app It says I have a rare condition and need to talk to my GP Luckily I saw it and then had to ring up reception and stay on the line ad infinitum to make another follow up appointment to be done by phone with PERSON weeks later I am fine with the phone appmt Those are convenient I just feel like a number at your surgery I am however hopeful about the Well Eoman Vlinic Dr PERSON If I can just stick with seeing her and noone else for my needs my trust might get rebuilt a bit I am a patient that came from Redcliffe Street You are slightly better than they were I do miss their lumps bumps service though\n",
      "1.97 - I think the move to PERSON t has been very successful but of course this is partly because we only live about 300 yards away I find the messaging system difficult to use although to be fair I ve only used it once I simply drop a note into the surgery and I do get a very speedy response by text So a big thanks My experience of the surgery and the NHS in general is very positive\n",
      "1.94 - where to begin we have to listen to a long msg about how we need to be respectful to staff but that cuts both ways my experience both on the telephone and face to face with your reception desk leaves me wanting being spoken to by someone who doesn t make eye contact being given information that is factually incorrect being made to feel like asking questions is a burden i could go on there is zero accountability doing and good job or a bad one has the same result i will keep my job i have received text messages devoid of context or factually incorrect and i have to once again engage with reception staff to try and decipher All I receive by way of excuse or explanation is we have no money we are the nhs or we have no staff we are the nhs teaching people how to do a job effectively and efficiently with a pinch of accountability is down to mentors not finance\n",
      "1.92 - It s very frustrating to wait for a gp call to discuss hrt medication to then be referred to a menopause clinic who can t write me a prescription it s then handed back to the gp to write This involves so much more nhs time effort and delays than is needed what a waste of money when they could as my previous gp did just change the medication from the first phone call A huge waste of everyone s time\n",
      "1.90 - The answers to the questions are irrelevant because of the wording so I kept my answers neutral The staff members and doctors are all are very nice and work within the constraints posed Please please bring back the morning and afternoon walk in clinics That was what attracted me to the clinic 22 years ago The pandemic is well snd truly over so the NHS has no excuse not to allow this I would very much like feedback on this Thank you\n",
      "1.90 - It would have been better if you could have explained in advance what the NHS health assessment involves as other than the blood test which came back with only one result there wasn t much value in this assessments Questions asked were top generic For example there was a question how many hours you care for a child per week As a parent this makes no sense I think these health assessments could be of value but not in the current format\n",
      "1.90 - I went mostly deaf tried to call and was told to book online Booked online and the next day received a text for an inappropriate time I couldn t make Ended up just buying codeine from the pharmacy and hoping for the best Luckily I got better but it s scary how easily you could fall through the cracks and die in this country It feels like the NHS doesn t give a shit about anyone the system makes you feel inhuman\n",
      "1.87 - I m continually impressed with the level of healthcare I receive from the Violet Melchett Centre I m very aware that not many people are as lucky as me when it comes to the NHS which makes me even more grateful Service is always quick I love the PACTHES system if ever I m ill I know I will receive advice from a doctor the same morning that I make the enquiry and often have the medicine for treatment in hand the same morning\n",
      "1.84 - Appointments for my wife and I last week to receive RPV vaccine because of our age of 81 after were confirmed outside of the 79 age limit set by NHS but with flexibility by the surgery and II s doctors both who were made aware by us The vaccine is given without age restrictions in other countries as the RPV VACCINE can be administered in UK as well Disappointing at our age not to be supported by Stanhope administration as it was kindly from its doctors\n",
      "1.84 - JUST TO TALK 🗣️ TO DOCTOR 🧑‍⚕️ ON CALL FOR PRESCRIPTIONS TAKES 2️⃣ WEEKS DOCTOR SHOULD LOOK 👀 AT PATIENTS PRESCRIPTION AND PRIORITIES ABSOLUTELY 💯 APPALING NOT HAPPY AT ALL AS ESCITALORAM RUN OUT JUNE LAST YEAR TOO MANY MEDICATIONS 💊 TO TAKE AND TENDS TO FORGET TO REQUEST REPEAT 🔁 PRESCRIPTION RECEPTIONIST RUDE AND UNHELPFUL NO EMPATHY I WORK IN NHS TOO VERY DISAPPOINTED FIRST EXPERIENCE IN THIS SURGERY OTHERS ARE VERY HELPFUL AT ALL TIMES MY COLLEAGUE IS MY WITNESS AND HEARD ALL CONVERSATIONS\n",
      "1.76 - Your GP s say they will follow up but never do I have been trying with both GP and Cardiologist to get a replacement for Hydrochlorthiazide 25mg tablet that your pharmacist will no longer prescribe as it costs the NHS too much money since around September 2023 It is now 29 February 2024 after repeated calls messages in person requests at surgery from myself and with just two weeks remaining of the aforementioned tablet and NO WORD FROM EITHER GP OR CARDIOLOGIST as to which replacement tablet I should be on\n",
      "1.73 - Reception staff very helpful in rearranging the appointment for an NHS Health Check due to my changing shcedule Process was fine and friendly but discovered afterwards that my status as a non smoker had been incorrectly input as a smoker which no doubt would have impacted the output e g cardiovascular risk Also the print out was very difficult to decipher especially as it supposedly had colour coded metrics but was printed in black and white As a result the outcome was at worst misleading and potentially unnecessarily worrying at best just confusing\n",
      "1.72 - Overall I am totally happy with The Good Practice Excellent professional and caring staff from doctors to administrators to receptionists to nurses to pharmacy Many community based activities yoga walking singing so the whole person is cared for As with ALL GP surgeries in London patients sometimes do not comprehend the pressures on staff and the difficulty in accommodating so many needs such as timely appointments This is not the fault of the Good Practice It is more the general pressure on the NHS I feel fortunate to belong to such a splendid surgery\n",
      "1.70 - My initial enquiry was in respect of a prescription renewal Regrettably whilst I had indicated the need to collect at the Gloucester Road Boots it was sent elsewhere as there is a default pharmacy address on record I urgently needed a controlled drug and after a very rapid call back from a doctor at the practice this was quickly resolved Given perceived inaccessibility of NHS doctors this happily disabused such ideas and the reception personnel and pharmacy team worked well to help and showed admirable kindness when clearly they had many other calls upon them\n",
      "1.65 - You always feel that the goal is not to see patients The receptionist are very unfriendly and quite hostile It is also rare to ever see the same doctor and I think that I ve only ever seen the same doctor twice However that doctor left me doubting her ability which is maybe why she lasted longer I was offered my NHS checkup via email or text and tried over 3 months to make an appointment before giving up Overall I think the practice has sunk to an all time low Good news for the private sector I guess\n",
      "1.58 - I have been blessed to be registered at this clinic Very friendly efficient and respectful professional staff Dr PERSON is the best GP I ever had Not only does she exhibit a professiobal attitude but also supportive in every way ftom listening patiently with empathy and kindness to acting instantly on any raised matter and following up diligently on my medical issues left unaddressed or neglected I cannot Thank her enough for making me and my husband feel home after we moved back to the UK recently and feel estranged in all this digitized new NHS system let alone the whole country itself Forever grateful🙏\n",
      "1.57 - The nurse was very good Dr PERSON not so good She basically told me the lymphoma on my back will get bigger and as it s not malignant there was nothing that could be done Someone at the hospital told me it could be drained but PERSON said no I then showed her my foot and a lump between toes She told me to get some corn plasters and that the NHs did not do podiatry any more I researched a local podiatrist anyway went to see them and was told it s a verruca Surely the GP could have known this and advised me accordingly\n",
      "1.46 - My consultation was a bad experience The doctor did not seem sympathetic to my situation She told me my pain was normal even though I had told her I was in so much pain that I couldn t leave the house and spent most of the day lying down The doctor did not seem to have read my online consultation as she was asking me many things that I had already communicated I m aware that some of this is required but it was clear from her questions and responses that she had not read my consultation It also seemed that she did not read my notes as a lot of the consultation was me trying to recall the names of the medications I had been given in the past The doctor gave me information and advice that contradicted the information I had received a week earlier from an NHS consultant and is on the NHS website The GP also refused to help me to help me with an urgent referral that had not gone through and told me just to ring them myself I was not reassured by my appointment with the GP My pain continued to get worse and the next morning I called 111 who told me to go to A E where I received medication and a referral for an urgent scan the same day I have received no follow up care from the GP\n",
      "1.36 - It s very frustrating the process of booking any appointments the waiting time to see a doctor is for a phone call with the doctors 1week while for a in person appointment is 2 weeks Receptionists take liberty to decide if you are urgent or not and booking the appointments accordingly saying the doctors are busy then when you go in person there isn t anyone in the clinic and doctors are free The doctors take everything lightly and they don t even check your symptoms refuse to make referrals to the NHS and suggest to go privately Sometimes i wait 2 3months before seeing my GP as I know the answer will always be you have nothing so don t worry by only looking my face\n",
      "1.22 - Dr PERSON and PERSON have always been first class Especially on the odd occasions when I needed rapid access and support regarding medical urgencies The latest example was when I needed an urgent NHS hospital transfer to the Royal Marsden after previous cancer trratments at another hospital failled and delays in dealing quickly with a more pernicious mutation of emerging tumours became dangeroisly worrying The speed with which Dr PERSON effected my transfer made it posdible for me be urgently seen very quickly by a top cancer consultant and rapidly undergo blood tests MRI and PET scans quickly followed up with intense chemotherapy which enabled me to then go onto chemoradiotherapy and I am now on immunology trials The support team on reception are also very helpful and PERSON the nurse provides Very good and comprehensive tests of patient vitals including bloods and ECGs\n",
      "1.22 - I feel very fortunate to be registered at this practice because The care and attention I have received over the years has been exemplary I have been monitored regularly for blood pressure and cholesterol changes and have been efficiently issued with the appropriate prescriptions and vaccinations Had my GP not seen the slight rise in my PSA levels I would not have had the opportunity to receive excellent prostrate cancer treatment and after care from Royal Marsden in their Rapid Diagnostic Centre Happily over the last two years I have had very positive outcomes from the mandatory blood tests and now on 6 monthly checks instead of three monthly At 78 I remain in full time professional practice and have not had to take a single day off on account of my health Thank you to the GP Surgery Royal Marsden and the NHS\n",
      "1.22 - Responses interactions and access to the doctors and nursing staff have always been excellent prompt friendly and considerate Follow up with repeat prescriptions c are also excellent There have been a few occasions in the past when individuals on the reception desk have seemed brusque or impatient though I can t imagine this was intentional and more recently they have been much more welcoming and helpful Perhaps an NHS wide issue is inter site department communication between specialist hospital provision and surgery monitoring resulting in duplication of procedures such as blood pressure and other function tests For example I have a wide spectrum of tests at Chelsea Westminster twice a year as part of my ongoing HIV management but I suspect these are not passed to you despite my permission to do so If they were they could save surgery time collecting the data again\n",
      "1.18 - I recently attended an NHS health check at the surgery During the first appointment I waited 45mins for my appointment due to computer issues I was eventually seen The next day I was called to make another appointment as my appointment details had been lost She had been unable to give me a printout at that time I attended the second appointment 10 days later There were at least four further computer issues during that consultation we had to keep waiting for a nurse to attend to solve the issues My states were taken but due to the crashes and general panic there could be inaccuracies with some of the basic answers I had given There was little advice received and it was all very painful Nevertheless I do appear be in reasonably good health so am happy to move on I felt sorry for the woman conducting my check\n",
      "1.11 - It is inconceivable that this business model could actually exist in the private sector I have given up on trying to get an appointment if I am sick and will go privately as a matter of course However the only interactions I now get with the NHS are via text messages inviting me in for Covid vaccines which I assume is an attempt to either kill me which you so far have failed to or to vaccinate the control group covering up a crime against humanity Occasionally I get an invitation for shingles vaccines too which I assume is rampant as the populations immunity to zoster virus appears to be damaged by the mRNAs I expect you will offer vaccines for vaccines that treated vaccines next I believe by failing to properly fully disclose all information regarding all the vaccine harms from Covid vaccines you willfully denied informed consent which I assume is against the Nuremberg Convention Have a nice day\n",
      "1.07 - I am 72 and still find it disconcerting not to be able easily to see the same doctor in person if I need to I do miss the personal contact with someone familiar with my medical history But I am getting better at using the new system of phone conversations you have to think harder about how to describe what is wrong rather than just show and tell In particular I have had a lot of help from practice nurses and pharmacists associated with the practice and the system for vaccinations etc during lockdown was excellent The only thing I have noticed is that the recording systems for blood pressure readings don t always link up so I have sent readings as requested by I think the NHS more centrally which haven t registered with the surgery but staff are very helpful and sort it out quickly The online system for renewing prescriptions is brilliant but I do wonder how older people who are not happy with computers manage\n",
      "1.06 - Upon checking in for my appointment I was informed that there were zero appointments before mine and that the expected waiting time was one minute However I ended up waiting for almost half an hour When I approached the reception to clarify this discrepancy the receptionist rudely dismissed my concern insisting that I had only been waiting for a mere three minutes I found this response to be both unprofessional and dismissive which only added to my frustration Additionally during the same visit another receptionist booked me for the wrong appointment despite my clear and repeated explanations of what I required As a result I had to wait for an incorrect appointment leading to further delays and the need to rebook the correct appointment This not only wasted my time but also caused significant inconvenience I am deeply concerned by the lack of professionalism and the substandard level of service I received I expect a certain standard of care from the NHS and this experience fell well below that standard\n",
      "1.05 - At present the staff and many of them I ve known for many years are excellent the only one thing I would say is lack of water and when it s hot the waiting room is very hot apart from that I actually don t have any complaints I m very very pleased and proud to be a patient that has access to Scarsdale over the many years I ve been with you guys I think I must be one of the luckiest in London and more importantly there is a level of compassion and empathy within many of the staff which I am afraid is missing quite commonly within the NHS I do understand that that s due to stress levels hard work and all the rest of it however you guys manage to keep it together Thank you very much I look forward to seeing you on Wednesday hope my results come out okay and if not I m sure I ll be in safe hands With thanks Mr PERSON PERSON\n",
      "1.04 - I wish I had a recent experience with my surgery GP However I feel sorry to tell you that he took about 3 weeks to speak to someone acting for Emperors Gate surgery The gentleman a physicist working for different surgeries had been very busy and I am sure he has He listened to me and I received a message from the surgery inviting me to phone and get an appointment to speak to a doctor about my need that is to find a way to deal with my painful kidney At last the lady at the other end of the phone was very helpful and very articulate confirmed I could speak to a doctor on the 13 2 pm over 2 weeks waiting time added to the previous 3 weeks 5 weeks overall If the early receptionist 5 weeks ago had been up to the task that is answering the telephone advised the patient and organise the ultimate appointment I won t be sending this message and the NHS would have saved time\n",
      "0.98 - PERSON is the best she was extremely supportive and kind throughout my appointment Dr PERSON was also amazing with my partner for his appointment However my appointment with Dr PERSON was not good and I don t feel comfortable talking to her again she started off our appointment with incorrect assumptions that I was privately diagnosed with ADHD but she had my diagnosis letter up on her screen with the NHS logo in the corner and it also explains in the first few lines that it is Right To Choose she immediately went on to mention the influx of private diagnoses and the BBC panorama whilst I understand her concerns her approach was not a good one at all and showed heavy skepticism which immediately make me uncomfortable I was caught off guard and did get a little emotional but not massively whilst she did backtrack from this once I explained how ADHD affects my life which is why I got emotional how it is harmful for her as a clinician to take the approach she is taking especially largely quoting a very damaging sensationalist TV program as opposed to reliable sources and how frustrating it is to have waited for so long to be diagnosed to be told that I may not be able to get medication when it isn t our fault as patients that the ADHD waiting lists are so long I wouldn t mind doing a regular NHS assessment but the issue is that we can t access them not that we as patients don t want to and are choosing to pay for a diagnosis which I didn t anyhow I do sympathise with her concerns and understand as a clinician she should raise any concerns she has my problem is that she didn t take an open minded curious approach and on top of that when I later read her notes on my record I realised that she has gotten the details largely incorrect facts she recorded about my life as well as recording that I was upset that she needed to discuss things between the team which isn t the case at all I was only upset about the approach having being caught off guard and frustrated by the ADHD system overall given how massively it impacts my life A more kind curious and sympathetic approach would have been appreciated and I don t feel that referring to the panorama is very appropriate as a source of information given the issues with the reporting I feel uncomfortable asking to correct the notes because I don t want to come across as difficult or pedantic or for it to have a negative impact on my relationship with the practice or my future care I have had largely positive interactions with the NHS but the negative ones including a previous misdiagnosis where the clinician ignored my concerns have had a damaging impact on my confidence in the healthcare system and made me rather reluctant to engage with it I try not to be cynical but it feels hard to advocate for yourself as a patient and it s also been very difficult to access treatment aside from Right to Choose not in terms of referrals because I ve not experienced any issues there at all my past GP was great with this I haven t yet needed any at The Chelsea Practice but in terms of waiting lists it feels a little pointless to try\n",
      "0.97 - I went to Violet Melchett Surgery for the first time and had my blood tests done After this their reception team texted me to make an appointment because my results indicated that I need to consult the doctor I was told this I tried to make an appointment there was no appointment available for 2 weeks When I suggested a date after 2 weeks the receptionist would NOT even discuss it as they only open the bookings 2 weeks ahead apparently So she told me to ring a week or so later THIS IS AN ADMIN SYSTEM CONSTRUCTED FOR THE BENEFIT OF ADMINISTRATORS NOT PATIENTS I work as a speech therapist in the NHS and I was appalled at her rigidity She also told me that the doctors at the surgery prefer telephone consultations This is very convenient for them I do not believe a doctor can diagnose on the phone On 11th JUNE I ended up at A E and was diagnosed with UTI How can they give a urine test on the telephone They cannot This is NOT patient care this is CONVENIENCE CARE for the GP herself\n",

      "0.86 - I have recently moved to the area from Australia and registered at this practice I was needed a repeat prescription for a medication I have been on for around 5 years I was given a phone appointment which is ok however as I have never been to the practice nor ever been to a gp in the uk I was expecting to have an in person appointment I was lucky to get a same day phone appointment The problems started while on the phone to the gp stated they don t often prescribe the medication I am usually on but could give be a months dose and gave me a list of alternative medications My concern is that this medication is an antidepressants that I have been stable on for 5 years From my understanding the practice and gps do not want to prescribe me the medication as it cost the practice more than alternatives which have not worked for me the past The gp is putting their need wants ahead of the patient that they are meant to be caring for If the practice refuses to continue to prescribe this medication for me I will have to look into a private go which as a nurse working in the nhs is not an sustainable option for me\n",
      "0.75 - The front desk staff are dedicated and so good at their job I can t speak more highly about the service they provide and some of the doctors including Doctor PERSON who is currently with the practice have been admirable However there is no consistency and no follow through After being referred to a specialist department for further investigation the box is ticked and the patient is cast adrift and left to sink or swim because unless they make a fuss and pester the practice after the referral they are not contacted again Half the problem is that the doctors are never in the practice for any length of time Just as the patient gets to know a doctor and more Importantly the doctor gets to know the patient and take an interest in them the doctor is moved on and the patient has lost the invaluable link with someone who is familiar with their medical history it is just a conveyor belt of people on the move and the insight and help a doctor can provide through personal knowledge of the patient is lost The thing is not all practices are like this Friends in Forest Gate with a tremendous diversity of patients from all over the world where a team of interpreters is on standby tell me the NHS treatment they receive from their local GP Practice is outstanding and very personal with patients being rung by doctors to see how they are doing and same day appointments are nearly always available\n",

      "0.00 - I have not had a recent appointmen but I thought I would answer anyway My experience is that when I need a doctor I find it hard to get an appointment unless urgent I need to have a telephone consultation first I was once told I think it was for a persistent and annoying cough that I had had for months after a laryngitis and I wanted to know if there was a cough medicine I could take I was told I should go to A and E but it was not THAT urgent I just needed advice I was quite disappointed and then went to a private GP She saw me the day afterwards scheduled a chest Xray and got me a prescription Also some friends of my age we are all oldies get check ups by their GP but so far I have had to ask for blood tests sometimes asked for by my cardiologist sometimes because I felt a long time had gone by I am aware that COVID has been very detrimental for everybody patients and doctors from many points of view and my problems are minor compared to others However as a result I am stuck seeing a private dermatologist My check ups for a suspicious mole on my back I live alone and have no way to check this myself were continuously cancelled or postponed but I needed it to be seen on consultant s advice in three months Admittedly this was not the GP it was the hospital Now I would be happy to see the GP for regular check ups rather than going to the private consultations So it would be useful to have a regular check up that is my point I have been seen by different doctors not often and they were very nice and one in particular was helpful getting me quick appointments for my thyroid problem I have been impressed with the notices I receive for vaccinations and general information like recently when I was given a possibility to be checked for atrial fibrillation I would have come but was out of the country The staff at the reception is always helpful and kind\n",

      "0.00 - The surgery clearly has too many patients Getting any appointment has been so difficult that I have had to go private Despite the fact that I m one of the highest tax payers in this country I have limited access to my GP I think it s absolutely appalling that patients have to wait over a week sometimes to get an appointment and then that appointment is solely over the telephone You can t diagnose chest infections over the phone Plus my mother has really been suffering for over a year with pain in her legs hips and groin and was not seem at all Instead she was sent off to some physio to get some exercise pointers She was only given one session and no one has bothered to follow up despite saying they would Plus the surgery focuses its attention on all the wrong things simply to fulfil government mandates rather than actually take care of patient needs I miss the old surgery when there was a walk in for more urgent enquiries and there was better client care Frankly this surgery should not be taking on any more patients because it is incapable of taking care of the patients it does have\n",

      "0.00 - I am only giving this feedback because I was invited to do so and so I must speak the truth as I see it From a recent visitation to the clinic it gives me enough motivation to say this I believe the clinic has a responsibility to attend to the needs of their patients rather than to pre assume their needs I also believe that the role of a clinic is not just to tend to the sick but to also tend to the healthy so that the healthy remain healthy and the sick are cured and made healthy This makes the clinic a clinic for all people and a cornerstone for peopleâ€™s lives to show that a clinic cares for the patient regardless of how sick they are This build a strong foundation for a trusting and healthy society That is why I believe it is important for the clinic to allow general health examinations for healthy or sick patients where the goal is for the doctor to assess analyse and highlight any health problems concerns or issues that come up in tests or examinations of the patientâ€™s body which can include but not limited to tests that record the health of their organs general fitness assessment of fat storages sugar levels or any general precursor known through modern research to future illness There is a saying that goes that prevention is better than cure and we should strive to build a preventative clinic as well as a clinic that cures I trust the expertise of the doctors to find suitable tests for us instead of us needing to play the role of the doctor and ask the doctors for tests we are not educated about Please also recognise that in this scenario the patient may not be aware of any medical issues or conditions because it is the role of the doctor to tell the patient if there are health concerns or risks that they should look out for this could be diet fitness or even assessments of general muscular and spinal health I was appalled at the lack of knowledge surrounding preventative assessments we as patients do not wish to come to you when we are sick we would rather come to you healthy and have the doctor affirm and verify that there are no health concerns and we do not have to come back often I believe the management should be capable of figuring out time periods for patients so that a general health check up doesnâ€™t happen all the time The doctors also should know what Iâ€™m talking about I simply cannot believe that they are ignorant of what a general health and body examination is I believe that staff should learn to love one another as well as their patients to treat them with dignity and respect and unfortunately one doctor is ruining the reputation for all of you but I do not wish to give out names The staff should communicate with each other and show love and respect for one another and not to dismiss and ignore for we all share this broken world and we do not know when our time is up The staff should show love and respect to patients because they have placed their trust in you I do not believe it is helpful to portray patients in a negative light or to be judgemental of their background or assuming of where they come from We all want to build a positive and happy work environment that patients can see and staff can enjoy Management should be equipped with methods to do that I pray that future patients will not receive what I experienced because it can be very hurtful for those who are anxious about their health and I had anxiety attacks and heart palpitations for 4 hours after the consultation I do not wish to dig further into the session and pulling out examples and evidence to prove my point and pedantic about terminologies and truth conditions as I experienced in the clinic breaks trust and does not build rapport with patients because I see it as a form of interrogation and is unbecoming of a health clinic that is supposed to form positive and happy relationships with patients Putting patients on the spot to recall facts about their medical history to try and trip them in the session where the facts have already been disclosed shows a lack of trust and communication from staff and a hostile tone I hope that staff will be happy and motivated to be thoughtful advisory and honest about the medical status of patients showing patient care and their history with other doctors so they donâ€™t have to assess patients fresh and I pray that light will shine on Scarsdale to improve and that staff are happy and are friends with each other in their workplace It is hurtful for me to see staff that are unhappy because it makes me unhappy and it doesnâ€™t improve my mental health when I see doctors and staff who I look up to and respect who themselves seem to need medical attention I hope you will take this advice constructively and I do not wish to be confrontational at all God bless you and may better days come\n",
